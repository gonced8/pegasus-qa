An artist's conception of the Charge of the Light Brigade Although the war itself is only a dim recollection, what is vividly remembered is one valorously tragic incident of the campaign: the headlong cavalry charge of the British Light Brigade into murderous Russian fire; an action immortalized by Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem. The Charge of the Light Brigade took place during a battle near the city of Balaclava on October 25, 1854. Through a miscommunication of orders, the Light Brigade of approximately 600 horsemen began a headlong charge into a treeless valley with the objective of capturing some Russian field artillery at its end. Unbeknown to them, the valley was ringed on three sides by some 20 battalions of Russian infantry and artillery. The result was disastrous. An estimated 278 of the Light Brigade were killed or wounded. Observing the charge, a French Marshall remarked: \"It is magnificent, but it is not war. It is madness.\" When news of the action reached London, it caused a national scandal that prompted Tennyson to pen his poem. History remembers the charge of the Light Brigade as an example of the extraordinary bravery of the British soldier in the face of enemy fire in spite of poor leadership.\n\n\"The Charge of the Light Brigade was a charge of British cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854 in the Crimean War. The charge was the result of a miscommunication in such a way that the brigade attempted a much more difficult objective than intended by the overall commander Lord Raglan. Blame for the miscommunication has remained controversial, as the original order itself was vague. The charge produced no decisive gains and resulted in very high casualties, and is best remembered as the subject of the poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, whose lines emphasize the valor of the cavalry in carrying out their orders, even \"tho' the soldier knew/Some one had blunder'd\". The charge was made by the Light Brigade of the British cavalry, consisting of the 4th and 13th Light Dragoons, 17th Lancers, and the 8th and 11th Hussars, under the command of Major General the Earl of Cardigan. Together with the Heavy Brigade comprising the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, the 5th Dragoon Guards, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons and the Scots Greys, commanded by Major General James Yorke Scarlett, himself a past Commanding Officer of the 5th Dragoon Guards, the two units were the main British cavalry force at the battle. Overall command of the cavalry resided with Lieutenant General the Earl of Lucan. Cardigan and Lucan were brothers-in-law who disliked each other intensely.\n\nThat's the result of faithfulness to the truth, having no gaps in your armour, standing firm for God in the face of conflict. So, to stand firm for God, you need to be prepared with the armour of truth. The second action we must take is to be prepared with... II. The Armour Of Righteousness Stand therefore...having put on the breastplate of righteousness (14b). The breastplate is the piece of armour that protects the body on every side. If you've ever studied some of the outstanding works of poetry in school, you will know Alfred Lord Tennyson's well known poem about the Balaclava charge of the British to certain death called \"The Charge of the Light Brigade.\" Half a league, half a league, half a league onward, Into the valley of Death rode the six hundred. 'Forward, the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!' he said: Into the valley of Death rode the six hundred. 'Forward, the Light Brigade!' Was there a man dismay'd? Not tho' the soldier knew someone had blunder'd: Their's not to make reply, their's not to reason why, Their's but to do and die: Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred. Cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them, volley'd and thunder'd; Storm'd at with shot and shell, boldly they rode and well,\n\nIn other words, are charge resolutions simultaneous or not? This was important in the game as the French brigade had one bon retreating and a good outcome of the Russian charge would have put the Frech center in falter status Skirmish evading charge A Russian bon charges the extreme left position of a French's brigade skirmish line (see below) According to the book, the French must evade if passing a DT which they successfully completed Question: should the WHOLE skirmish line evade and reposition behind the friendly close order infantry units? This was important because in the firing phase the rest of the Russian brigade could volley fire the packed French close order units Alternatively: can the French skirmish base in the area of the charge"

      "Model_input": "where did the running of the bulls tradition come from in spain?\n\nThe origin of this event comes from the need to transport the bulls from the fields outside the city, where they were bred, to the bullring, where they would be killed in the evening. [4] During this \"run\", youngsters would jump among them to show off their bravado. In Pamplona and other places, the six bulls in the event are still those that will feature in the afternoon bullfight of the same day. Spanish tradition holds that bull-running began in northeastern Spain in the early 14th century. While transporting cattle in order to sell them at the market, men would try to speed the process by hurrying their cattle using tactics of fear and excitement. After years of this practice, the transportation and hurrying began to turn into a competition, as young adults would attempt to race in front of the bulls and make it safely to their pens without being overtaken. When the popularity of this practice increased and was noticed more and more by the expanding population of Spanish cities, a tradition was created and stands to this day. [5] [ non-primary source needed ] Contents 1 Pamplona bull run 1.1 Fence 1.2 Preliminaries 1.3 The running 1.4 Injuries, fatalities, and medical attention 1.5 Dress code 1.6 Media 2 Other examples 2.1 Correbous or bous al carrer 2.2 Occitan area of France\n\nOnce we arrived to the bull farm, we were warmly welcomed by the owner who showed us around the property and told us about its architecture and history. Visiting a horse and bull farm in Andalusia After that, our guests were explained by her, how brave bulls are bred, how they live and the complexity of running a farm where also many other agricultural and farming activities take place. Agriculture and farming in Andalusia Of course we took them to see her beautiful brave bulls from a very close perspective! A beautiful brave bull from Andalusia We love connecting travelers and locals and the beautiful culture exchange that it triggers. This was a lovely example, with which everyone got to learn about a very important tradition of Andalusia as well as about one of its most important economic activities: agriculture. With all the knowledge acquired in the bull farm, we took our guests to see another beautiful animal from Spain: the Spanish Purebred Horse. This was in the Royal School of Equestrian Art in Jerez, where we enjoyed together with them, the impressive show where the horses dance to lovely classical music. Did we say that our guests were very sensitive? During the show, we saw one of our guests with tears in her eyes. She was immensely moved by the nobility and elegance of these animals.\n\nIn 2014, the eBook guide, Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona, caused headlines around the world when one of the contributors was gored by a bull soon after its publication. [28] (See Further Reading section below.) Other examples [ edit ] Fire bull and children running from it ( Tudela, Navarre ) Although the most famous running of the bulls is that of San Fermin, [2] they are held in towns and villages across Spain, Portugal, and in some cities in southern France during the summer. Examples are the bull run of San Sebastian de los Reyes, near Madrid, at the end of August which is the most popular of Spain after Pamplona, the bull run of Cuellar, considered as the oldest of Spain since there are documents of its existence dating back to 1215, the Highland Capeias of the Raia in Sabugal, Portugal, with horses leading the herd crossing old border passes out of Spain and using the medieval 'Forcao', or the bull run of Navalcarnero held at night. Other encierros have also caused fatalities. [29] Correbous or bous al carrer [ edit ] Bous al carrer at Albocasser Bous al carrer, correbou or correbous (meaning in Catalan, 'bulls in the street','street-bulls') is a typical festivity in many villages in the Valencian region, Terres de l'Ebre, Catalonia, and Fornalutx, Mallorca. Another similar tradition is soltes de vaques, where cows are used instead of bulls. Even though they can take place all along the year, they are most usual during local festivals (normally in August). Compared to encierros, animals are not directed to any bullring.\n\nSee also [ edit ] Bou embolat or toro embolado - variant in which bulls have flares or fireworks attached to their horns Bull-baiting Bullfighting Spanish-style bullfighting Bull-leaping (ancient) Course landaise (modern France) Recortes (modern Spain) Bull running - a similar, defunct tradition in England Jallikattu - a similar tradition in Tamil Nadu, India Sokamuturra,"

She is considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first country music artists to successfully crossover into pop music. [8] [9] Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the Billboard Hot Country and Western Sides chart. Cline's first professional performances began at the local WINC radio station when she was fifteen. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on Connie B. Gay's Town and Country television broadcasts. It also led to the signing of her first recording contract with the Four Star label in 1954. She had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including \"A Church, A Courtroom and Goodbye\" (1955) and \"I've Loved and Lost Again\" (1956). In 1957 however, Cline made her first national television appearance on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. After performing \" Walkin' After Midnight \", the single would become her first major hit on both the country and pop charts.\n\nCline's follow-up singles to \"Walkin' After Midnight\" did not yield any success. [17] This was partially due to the quality of material chosen for her to record. [49] Cline was dissatisfied with the limited success following \"Walkin' After Midnight\". Bradley recounted how she often came to him saying, \"Hoss, can't you do something? I feel like a prisoner.\" [44] Around the same time, Cline was fired from her regular slot on Town and Country Jamboree. According to Connie B. Gay, she ran late for shows and \"showed up with liquor on her breath.\" [50] In September 1957, Cline married Charlie Dick and he was soon sent to Fort Bragg, North Carolina on a military assignment. [51] Cline also gave birth to her first daughter Julie. In hopes of restarting her career, Cline and her family moved to Nashville, Tennessee. [17] 1960-1961: New beginnings and car accident [ edit ] Cline promotional photograph shortly before her 1961 life-threatening car accident Cline's professional decisions yielded more positive results by the early 1960s. Upon moving to Nashville, she signed a management deal with Randy Hughes. [17] She originally wished to work with Hubert Long, however, he was busy managing other artists. Instead, she turned her attention to Hughes. [44] With the help of Hughes, she began working steadier jobs. He organized fifty dollar bookings and got her multiple performances on the Grand Ole Opry. [17] In January 1960, Cline officially became a member of the Opry. [51] When she asked general manager Ott Devine about a membership he replied, \"Patsy, if that's all you want, you're on the Opry.\" [52] Also in January 1960, Cline made her final recording sessions set forth in her contract with Four Star Records. Later that year, her final singles with the label were released: \" Lovesick Blues \" and \"Crazy Dreams\". Leaving Four Star, Cline officially signed with Decca Records in late 1960, working exclusively under Bradley's direction. [53] Insisting on receiving an advance, she received $1,000 from Bradley once she began at the label. [18]\n\nPatsy signed with Four Star Records in 1955 where she recorded only honky-tonk material provided by Four Star writers. The deal lasted just three years. She then signed with Decca Records and was introduced to Owen Bradley a producer who thought her voice was best suited for pop music. While looking for material for her first album, she came across a song titled Walkin' After Midnight. Cline didn't like it as she regarded it as nothing more than"

[8] Minder became the longest-running series produced by Euston Films, surviving for over a decade following Lambert's departure from the company. [15]\n\nNeil Cross said: Nathan, Bob and Holly have been with me for many years. I couldn't be more excited to see them brought to life by Russell Tovey, Bertie Carvel and Amrita Acharia Executive Producers, Kate Harwood and Noemi Spanos said: We're very excited to be working with the brilliant Russell Tovey in this lead role, we've always been great fans and we are delighted to have him play Nathan. We are excited and know him, Bertie and the rest of the cast will do a fantastic job of bringing Neil's propulsive thriller to life Because the Night is a Euston Films production for ITV and is distributed internationally by Fremantle. The series was commissioned for ITV by Head of Drama, Polly Hill. The series is inspired by the novel Burial, also written by Neil Cross (Luther, Hard Sun, Spooks, Mama). Euston Films Managing Director Kate Harwood (Dublin Murders, Hard Sun, Baghdad Central) will executive produce the drama alongside Executive Producer for Euston Films, Noemi Spanos (Dublin Murders). Niall MacCormick (The Victim, The Durrells, Doctor Thorne) will direct each of the 4 x 60' episodes. Jonathan Curling (Tin Star, Baghdad Central) will produce. The series will film till December and will air on ITV later next year. Note to Editors: About Euston Films Part of Fremantle, Euston Films is a prestige label with an international reputation for ground-breaking, iconic drama. Euston Films was relaunched in Autumn 2014, with Kate Harwood as Managing Director and Noemi Spanos as Creative Director. Hard Sun was Euston Films' inaugural production, a 6-part drama series for BBC One written by Neil Cross (Luther). Euston Films has two further ambitious drama series coming soon - Dublin Murders, an 8-part series for BBC One from writer Sarah Phelps (The ABC Murders), and Baghdad Central, a 6-part series for Channel 4 from writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom).\n\nThe Crunch and Other Stories is available now from Network and all good retailers. Leave a comment Quatermass (John Mills 1979) - Network BD/DVD Review July 25, 2015 July 15, 2016 archivetvmusings ITV Drama - 1970's john mills, network, nigel kneale, quatermass After rewatching Euston Films' 1979 production of Nigel Kneale's Quatermass a few months ago I mused that it would be nice if Network were able to acquire the rights and release a restored version on BD. And just to prove that wishes do sometimes come true, Quatermass will be released by Network on BD and DVD on the 27th of July 2015. It's especially welcome since the previous release, long since deleted, was only available on DVD and the picture quality left more than a little to be desired. Quatermass was an unusual project for British television at the time, due to the fact it was filmed on 35mm. Filmed programmes were becoming more common, but by the late 1970's they tended to be shot on 16mm. Because Euston wanted to recut the series for theatrical release in the US, it was obviously decided that it was worth investing the extra money to shoot on 35mm stock and that's very good news. Network have already released several impressive BDs sourced from 16mm material (The Professionals, The Sweeney, Robin of Sherwood) but since this was a 35mm series the resulting PQ will be even better.\n\nHS2"

[16] [17] [66] On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment Chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that The Jay Leno Show would indeed move to 11:35. [67] Leno immediately accepted the return to 11:35 p.m., calling the move \"all business.\" [68] He had made it known in the press in November 2009 that he wished to return to his old timeslot; [55] behind the scenes, Leno had privately indicated that he did not believe the 10:00 experiment would work. [69] On the other hand, O'Brien's contract stipulated that the network could move the show back to 12:05 a.m. without penalty, a loophole put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions, the network's traditional nightly Wimbledon tournament highlights show, and specials such as New Year's Eve with Carson Daly. [70] O'Brien did not seriously respond for several days after the announcement, then drafted a press release explaining why he felt it was unfair to him, his staff, Fallon, and the legacy of The Tonight Show to move the show past midnight. He concluded by saying that he \"cannot participate in what I honestly believe is [ The Tonight Show' s] destruction.\" [2] [71] O'Brien received an outpouring of celebrity and viewer support for rejecting the move, [72] while Leno received heavy criticism. [72] [73] [74] On January 21, O'Brien signed a $45 million deal allowing him to leave the network, and aired his final episode of Tonight on January 22; Leno returned as host of Tonight on March 1.\n\nNBC's decision resulted in a major public conflict between the network and Conan O'Brien, who asserted that the move would damage the highly respected Tonight Show franchise, and that he would not participate in the program if it were moved to 12:05. [2] Despite much support for O'Brien from both the public [3] and media professionals [4] [5] alike, NBC maintained its plan to move Leno to 11:35. On January 21, 2010, NBC reached a $45 million settlement with O'Brien in order to end his contract. The Jay Leno Show ended on February 9, 2010, after being on the air for only four months, with Entertainment Weekly calling the program television's \"Biggest Bomb of All Time.\" [6] Leno resumed his duties as host of The Tonight Show on March 1, 2010, for his second and final stint that lasted until his February 2014 succession by Jimmy Fallon.

Leno--who wanted to avoid an acrimonious transition like what he experienced when he inherited Tonight from Johnny Carson [8] --said at the announcement, \"You can do these things until they carry you out on a stretcher, or you can get out when you're still doing good.\" [9] He began to regret his decision to retire in 2007, [9] and several networks and studios including ABC, Fox, Sony, [10] and Tribune [11] expressed interest in his services after leaving Tonight.\n\nNumerous media outlets offered support of O'Brien, such as Gawker and The Examiner, as well as less usual outlets such as advertisements running on Adult Swim. Numerous parody videos appeared on sites like YouTube and Funny or Die in favor of O'Brien. Criticism of Leno [ edit ] Long-time late night rival David Letterman (formerly of NBC's Late Night with David Letterman, which followed The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and later host of The Late Show ) was critical of Leno and supportive of his former mentee O'Brien. Leno faced heated criticism and increasing negative publicity for his perceived role in the timeslot conflict, with some critics predicting that his reputation--along with those of Jeff Zucker and NBC as a whole--had been permanently damaged by the incident. [134] [135] [136] [137] Critics pointed to the 2004 Tonight Show clip wherein Leno claimed he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident. [137] [138]"

      "Model_input": "What is the Pralembrang Jayabaya?\n\nHindu Javanese emphasize with pride that their ancestors Sabdapalon and Jayabaya represent a golden pre-Islamic age. Islamic opponents, in turn, claim that Jayabaya was in fact a Muslim and that Sabdapalon had only resisted conversion because what he was confronted with at the time was but a muddled and impure version of Islam (Soewarno 1981). Nevertheless, Muslim and Hindu interpreters agree that this is the time of reckoning, of major political reform if not a revolution. They also tend to agree that a truly democratic system of government may only be realized with the help of a leader of the highest moral caliber, thus blending modern notions of democracy with traditional notions of charismatic leadership. That the prophesies of Jayabaya are of profound significance to Indonesians of very different persuasion and from all walks of life is illustrated by the secret visits (once before he was nominated as a presidential candidate and again before his election) of President Abdurahman Wahid (then head of the NU) to the ancestral origin temple of Raja Jayabaya in Bali, the remote mountain sanctuary Pura Pucak Penulisan. After a solitary nocturnal devotion at this ancient Hindu temple, as local priests told me, Gus Dur (the president's popular nickname) spoke with them at length about Jayabaya's prophesies and the imminent arrival of a new ratu adil. Opponents of Gus Dur have prefered to identify his government with another passage in the prophesies, which refer to \"a king whose [interim] rule shall last no longer than the life span of a maize plant\".\n\nSatrio Piningit - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia CentralNotice Satrio Piningit From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Satrio Piningit means \" Hidden Knight/ Hidden Ksatria \". He is a character of Jongko Joyobhoyo ( Jayabaya Prophecies ) in Javanese myths and he is a Javanese who would become a Great Leader of Nusantara and around the world from Java. Contents 1 Jongko Joyoboyo ( Jayabaya Prophecies ) 2 Jayabaya Prophecy of Satrio Piningit 2.1 Some Verses That Tells About Satrio Piningit 2.2 Analysis 3 See also 4 References Jongko Joyoboyo ( Jayabaya Prophecies ) [ edit ] Maharaja Jayabaya was a King of Kediri in East Java from 1135 to 1157 A.D. and he was known for his righteousness and prosperous rule, and reputed to have been an incarnation of the Hindu deity, Deva Vishnu so that he had a magical strength ( sakti manduroguno ) and he was abled to predict the future. Maharaja Jayabaya is most famous for his oracles or prophesies attributed to him, namely the Serat Joyobhoyo Musoror, Serat Pranitiwekyo, and some debatable others. Jayabaya is also attributed as author of the \" Pralembang Joyobhoyo \", a prophetic book that played an important role in the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945). According to a selectively abridged set of stanzas within a Jayabaya prophesy (all are extremely long epic poems):\n\nAnd then after independence of Indonesia, many Javanese people (until now) believe that Soekarno were Satrio Piningit. They thought Soekarno had a many of Satrio Piningit's characters. But many people of Indonesia do not believe it because Satrio Piningit would become a leader of the world, not only in Indonesia. And at the end of Soekarno, he treated inhumane by the New Order Regime (1967-1998), starting from rejection of Nawaksara Soekarno at court of MPRS 1966. Jayabaya only told about his coming from Java Island, and he will lead Nusantara and the last, he will rule the world. Jayabaya didn't tell about post-Satrio Piningit era, so that Satrio Piningit is only the dialectics process.

      "Model_input": "Did Robinson go on to have more Broadway shows after his third one?\n\nIn 1939, Robinson returned to the stage in The Hot Mikado, a jazz version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The show opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Robinson cast in the role of the Emperor. His rendition of My Object All Sublime stopped the show and produced eight encores. After Broadway, the show moved to the 1939 New York World's Fair, and was one of the greatest hits of the fair. August 25, 1939, was named Bill Robinson Day at the fair. [5] : p. 260 Robinson's next Broadway show, All in Fun (1940), was with an all-white cast. Despite having Imogene Coca, Pert Kelton, and other stars, the show received poor reviews at out-of-town tryouts in New Haven and Boston. When the white stars and co-producers, Phil Baker and Leonard Sillman, withdrew, Robinson became the star, the first time an African-American headlined an otherwise all-white production. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about Robinson, they panned the show, and it failed to attract audiences. All in Fun closed after four performances. [5] : pp. 273-275 Robinson's next foray on Broadway was the musical comedy Memphis Bound, which opened in May 1945. This production used an all-black cast including Robinson (who had top billing [15] ), Avon Long, Billy Daniels, Ada Brown, and Sheila Guyse. [16] Robinson played the boat pilot and then Sir Joseph Porter in the play-within-a-play of H.M.S. Pinafore. [17] Critics widely praised Robinson's performance and especially his dancing, [16] [17] [18] with his stair dance cited as a high point of the show. [17]\n\nRobinson's talents transcended his famous Stair Dance by far. The steps themselves were not essential to Robinson's performances; rather, Robinson would naturally shift into \"a little skating step to stop-time; or a Scoot step, a cross-over tap\" or many other tap steps involved in his particular movement quality. [1] : 187 Robinson changed rhythmic meters and tap steps and syncopated breaks seamlessly. Often Robinson would talk to his audience, share anecdotes, and act as if he were surprised by the action of his feet. His amusing personality was essential to his performances and popularity. Robinson is said to have consistently performed in split-soled wooden shoes, handcrafted by a Chicago craftsman. [10] Robinson in The Hot Mikado Broadway [ edit ] In 1928, a white impresario, Lew Leslie, produced Blackbirds of 1928 on Broadway, a black revue for white audiences starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Robinson along with Aida Ward, Tim Moore and other black stars. The show was a huge success on Broadway, where it ran for over one year to sell-out performances. On stage, Adelaide Hall and Robinson danced and sang a duet together, which captivated the audiences. From then on, Robinson's public role was that of a dapper, smiling, plaid-suited ambassador to the white world, maintaining a connection with the black show-business circles through his continuing patronage of the Hoofers Club, an entertainer's haven in Harlem. So successful was Adelaide Hall's collaboration with Bojangles, they even appeared together on stage at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) [11] before they were teamed up together again by Marty Forkins (Robinson's manager) [12] to star in another Broadway musical titled, \"Brown Buddies\", [13] that opened in 1930 at the Liberty Theatre, where it ran for four months before commencing a road tour of the States. [14]\n\nRobinson was a popular figure in both the black and white entertainment worlds of his era. He is best known today for his dancing with Shirley Temple in a series of films during the 1930s, and for starring in the musical Stormy Weather (1943), loosely based on his own life and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. He used his popularity to challenge and overcome numerous racial barriers, including becoming: one of the first minstrel and Vaudeville performers to appear without the use of blackface makeup one of the earliest black performers to go solo, overcoming vaudeville's two-colored rule [2] a headliner in Broadway shows the first black performer to appear in a Hollywood film in an interracial dance team (with Shirley Temple in The Little Colonel, 1935) the first black performer to headline a mixed-race Broadway production Robinson came under heavy criticism for his tacit acceptance of racial stereotypes of the era, with critics calling him an Uncle Tom. He resented such criticism, and his biographers suggested that critics were at best incomplete in making such a characterization, especially given his efforts to overcome racial prejudice. In his public life, Robinson led efforts to: persuade the Dallas Police Department to hire its first black policeman lobby"

      "Model_input": "What were the comics Highsmith wrote?\n\nHighsmith contributed financially to the Jewish Committee on the Middle East, [68] an organization founded in 1988 that represented American Jews who wanted the United States to \"dissociate... from the policies of Israel.\" [70] She wrote in an August 1993 letter to Marijane Meaker: \"USA could save 11 million per day if they would cut the dough to Israel. The Jewish vote is 1%.\" [71] Writing history [ edit ] Comic books [ edit ] After graduating from Barnard College, before her short stories started appearing in print, Highsmith wrote for comic book publishers from 1942 and 1948, while she lived in New York City and Mexico. Answering an ad for \"reporter/rewrite,\" she landed a job working for comic book publisher Ned Pines in a \"bullpen\" with four artists and three other writers. Initially scripting two comic-book stories a day for $55-a-week paychecks, Highsmith soon realized she could make more money by freelance writing for comics, a situation which enabled her to find time to work on her own short stories and live for a period in Mexico. The comic book scriptwriter job was the only long-term job Highsmith ever held. [6] From 1942-43, for the Sangor - Pines shop (Better/Cinema/Pines/Standard/Nedor), Highsmith wrote \"Sergeant Bill King\" stories and contributed to Black Terror and Fighting Yank comics; and wrote profiles such as Catherine the Great, Barney Ross, and Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker for the \"Real Life Comics\" series. From 1943-1946, under editor Vincent Fago at Timely Comics, she contributed to its U.S.A. Comics wartime series, writing scenarios for comics such as Jap Buster Johnson and The Destroyer. During these same years she wrote for Fawcett Publications, scripting for Fawcett Comics characters \"Crisco and Jasper\" and others. [72] Highsmith also wrote for True Comics, Captain Midnight, and Western Comics. [73]\n\nWhen Highsmith wrote the psychological thriller novel The Talented Mr. Ripley (1955), one of the title character's first victims is a comic-book artist named Reddington: \"Tom had a hunch about Reddington. He was a comic-book artist. He probably didn't know whether he was coming or going.\" [74] Early novels and short stories [ edit ] Highsmith's first novel, Strangers on a Train, proved modestly successful upon publication in 1950, and Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 film adaptation of the novel enhanced her reputation. How was it possible to be afraid and in love, Therese thought. The two things did not go together. How was it possible to be afraid, when the two of them grew stronger together every day? And every night. Every night was different, and every morning. Together they possessed a miracle. - The Price of Salt, chapter eighteen ( Coward-McCann, 1952) Highsmith's second novel, The Price of Salt, was published in 1952 under the nom de plume Claire Morgan. [75] Highsmith mined her personal life for the novel's content. [44] Its groundbreaking happy ending [76] [f] and departure from stereotypical conceptions about lesbians made it stand out in lesbian fiction. [77] In what BBC 2's \" The Late Show \" presenter Sarah Dunant described as a \"literary coming out\" after 38 years of disaffirmation, [78] Highsmith finally acknowledged authorship of the novel publicly when she agreed to the 1990 publication by Bloomsbury retitled Carol. Highsmith wrote in the \"Afterword\" to the new edition:\n\nBetween 1959 and 1961, Highsmith was in love with author Marijane Meaker. [49] [50] Meaker wrote lesbian stories under the pseudonym \"Ann Aldrich\" and mystery/suspense fiction as \"Vin Packer,\" and later wrote young adult fiction as \"M.E. Kerr.\" [50] In the late 1980s, after 27 years of separation, Highsmith began corresponding with Meaker again, and one day showed up on Meaker's doorstep, slightly drunk and ranting bitterly. Meaker later said she was horrified at how Highsmith's personality had changed. [c] Highsmith was attracted to women of privilege who expected their lovers to treat them with veneration. [51] According to Phyllis Nagy, she belonged to a \"very particular subset of lesbians\" and described her conduct with many women she was interested in as being comparable to a movie \"studio boss\" who chased starlets. Many of these women, who to some extent belonged to the 'Carol Aird'-type [d] and her social set, remained friendly with Highsmith and confirmed the stories of seduction. [26] An intensely private person, Highsmith was remarkably open and outspoken about her sexuality. [31] [33] She told Me"

Mr. Currie wore his white bucks that day. \"I had done a few special events but I always wanted to work in television and this was my first real job interview out of college,\" he remembered. \"So I dressed like I was going to a cocktail party, and well you know, she just loved that. She gravitated toward me.\" He calls his three years working on the live television show--which aired at 9 a.m., an admitted adjustment for Mr. Currie--\"a wild ride.\" A friendship grew. \"We got very friendly as the show went on,\" he said. \"And she just never let go. \"Looking back now on 25 years of Thanksgivings and Jewish holidays. I didn't even think about it. She was a wonderful role model and force in my life.\" His relationship with Melissa Rivers became close as well and remained that way after Joan's death. \"You become close to your family,\" Mr. Currie said. \"She is like the sister I never had and always wanted.\" Mr. Currie's favorite thing about Joan, besides her humor, was her friendship. \"She had an unbelievable and rare ability to be a friend. She understood what friendship meant.\" And while he is hard put to name his favorite parts of the book, he does admit to loving a fan letter from another pioneer.\n\nDuring the airing of her late-night show, she made the voice-over role of Dot Matrix in the science-fiction comedy Spaceballs (1987), a parody mainly on Star Wars. The film, directed and co-starring Mel Brooks, was a critical and commercial success, later becoming a \"cult classic\". [55] After the Fox controversy, her career went into hiatus. Rivers subsequently appeared on various television shows, including the Pee-wee's Playhouse Christmas Special in December 1989. She also appeared as one of the center square occupants on the 1986-89 version of The Hollywood Squares, hosted by John Davidson. On September 5, 1989, The Joan Rivers Show, her daytime television program, premiered in broadcast syndication. The show, which ran for five seasons, was a success and earned Rivers the Daytime Emmy in 1990 for Outstanding Talk Show Host. [56] Entertainment Weekly, in a September 1990 article, asserted: \" The Joan Rivers Show is a better showcase for her funny edginess than her doomed 1988 Fox nighttime program was. The best thing about her daytime talker is that Rivers' stream-of-consciousness chattiness is allowed to guide the show -- you never know where the conversation is going to go\". [57] 1990s [ edit ] In addition to winning the Emmy for The Joan Rivers Show, Rivers starred in the made-for-television comedy How to Murder a Millionaire, which premiered in May 1990 on CBS. In the film, co-starring Alex Rocco and Telma Hopkins, she took on the role of a Beverly Hills matron possessed with the idea her husband is trying to kill her. [58] Also in 1990, she started to design jewelry, clothing and beauty products for the shopping channel QVC. On this professional endeavor, Rivers said: \"In those days, only dead celebrities went on [QVC]. My career was over. I had bills to pay.... It also intrigued me at the beginning\". [59] The sales of Rivers' products exceed $1 billion by 2014, making her one of the network's top sellers. [60] In 1991, she wrote her next book, Still Talking, which described the cancellation of her late-night show and her husband's suicide. [61] Until 1993, she received five additional Emmy nominations for her daytime talk-show The Joan Rivers Show -- two for Outstanding Writing - Special Class and three for Outstanding Talk Show Host.

Again, just one person who was competitive. Not suggesting he was the tip of the iceberg. Click to expand... The facts are, Chris, that Abebe Bikila bested his barefoot time in 1960 at the Rome Olympics of 2:15:16.4 by 3 minutes and 4.8 seconds with a New World Record Time of 2:12:11.4 while running in shoes in his second Olympic marathon in 1964 in Tokyo. Therefore, what was the result of Abebe Bikila's wise decision to wear shoes instead of running barefoot in his second Olympic marathon? 1. A new world record. 2. A personal best by 3:04.8 (he ran 7 seconds faster per mile while in shoes than when running barefoot!) Based on this account alone of Abebe Bikila's Olympic Marathon performances, then racing marathons in shoes should give you a significant speed advantage over running barefoot. The thing I find quite amusing is that many barefoot running advocates, including Chris McDougall, use Abebe Bikila's example as to why everyone should run barefoot, instead of running in shoes. The reality is, however, when you look at Abebe Bikila's Olympic performances, the most logical conclusion that a non-biased individual would make was that running in shoes made Abebe Bikila faster and made him break the World Record! In other words, it is obvious that Abebe Bikila must have been slowed down by 7 seconds per mile by running barefoot!:drinks\n\nAbebe Bikila - Wikipedia CentralNotice Abebe Bikila From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is about a person whose name ends in a patronymic rather than a family name.

      "Model_input": "what are christ's two natures\n\nThe human and divine natures of Christ were essentially distinct as they were brought together, and though joined in the hypostatic union, a personal union, the two natures are not blended nor commingled. Moreover, the union thusly constituted is inseparable. As the Chalcedonian description implies, these natures are not converted into one another, that is, the divine into the human to make a divine man, or the human into the divine to make a human God. The two natures are also not compounded and blended together to no longer be distinguishable, to make a third that is different from the two. Lastly, the two natures are not confused in any manner, or so mixed together that the essential properties of both natures are indiscriminately existing in the theanthropic person. Instead the Chalcedonian description teaches that true deity and real humanity are joined together in an inseparable personal union in the person of Christ incarnate. Christ is truly God and really man. But there is only one Christ and one Mediator between God and man. While there are two centers of consciousness, there is but one divine self-consciousness in the Incarnate God, Christ. The theanthropic person is one, but constitutes the two natures, complete, but not commingled. Wrong thinking about the Incarnate Christ will lead to numerous misunderstandings and doctrinal error. If you have a biblical understanding, you will also agree with what follows on other important understandings of the Incarnation:\n\nThere's one final way he continues to be both God and human for eternity. \"he is God and man in one person forever.\" Throughout the history of the church, some have mistakenly thought of Christ as a divine person united to a human person, so that Christ had a double personality. But according to the Scriptures, Christ, though he possessed two natures, was only one person. So Christ, though he is a human being, is not a human person. From all eternity he has been a divine person. At a certain point in history, this divine person took upon himself, not a human person, but a human nature which lacked personality. Christ therefore was and is a divine person with a human nature. A human nature is what all members of the human race have in common, that is, a human body and a human soul. Personality is what distinguishes one member of the human race from all the others. In the matter of human nature, all human beings are exactly alike. In the matter of personality, of all the people that have ever lived, there have never been two alike; each individual is different from all others. We should be careful to avoid the popular misconception that considers Christ to be a human person. If Christ were a human person, it would be idolatry to worship him. But because he is a divine person, even though he possesses a human nature, it's not idolatry to worship him as the Christian church has always done.\n\nContents 1 Background 2 First attempt: Doctrine of one energy 3 Second attempt: Doctrine of one will 4 Conflict with Rome 5 Condemnation of Monothelitism 6 Controversy over Pope Honorius I 7 See also 8 References 9 Sources 10 External links Background [ edit ] The ongoing debates about the nature of Christ caused controversy within the Christian Church for centuries. During the 5th century, some regions of the Christian Church were thrown into confusion because of the debates that erupted over the nature of Jesus Christ. Although the Church had already determined that Christ is the son of God, just what his exact nature is remained open to debate. The Church had declared heretical the notion that Jesus is not fully divine in the 4th century (see First Council of Nicaea ), during the debates over Arianism and had declared that he is God the Son become human. However, in arguing that he is both God and man, there now emerged a dispute over exactly how the human and divine natures of Christ actually exist within the person of Christ. The Christological definition of Chalcedon, as accepted by the Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Reformed churches, is that Christ remains in two distinct natures, yet these two natures come together within his one hypostasis. More simply, Christ is known as \"both fully human and fully Divine, one in being with the Father\". This position was opposed by the Monophysites who held that Christ possesses one nature only. The term Monophysitism of which Eutychianism is one type, held that the human and divine natures of Christ were fused into one new single ( mono -) nature. As described by Eutyches, his human nature was \"dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea\", and therefore his nature is really divine. [2] This is distinct from Miaphysitism, which holds that, after the union, Christ is in one theanthropic (human-divine) nature and"

No mention any where here of an evil spirit.\" Thou seest how worthy he was to be saved: for when he beheld the miracle, and was relieved from his terror, he did not forget what most concerned him, but even in the midst of so great peril, he was solicitous about that salvation which concerned his soul: and came before them in such a manner as it was meet to come before teachers: he fell down at their feet. \"And they spake,\" it continues, \"the word of the Lord, unto him with all that were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.\" (Acts xvi. 32, 33.) Observe the fervency of the man! He did not delay; he did not say, \"Let day come, let us see, let us look about us;\" but with great fervency, he was both himself baptized, and all his house. Yes, not like most men now-a-days, who suffer both servants and wives and children to go unbaptized. Be ye, I beseech you, like the jailor. I say not, in authority, but in purpose; for what is the benefit of authority, where purpose is weak? The savage one, the inhuman one, who lived in the practice of unnumbered wrongs and made this his constant study, has become all at once so humane, so tenderly attentive. \"He washed,\" it is said, \"their stripes.\"\n\nIt is written, AND THIS IS THE CONDEMNATION (or judgment or verdict), THAT LIGHT (which is Jesus) IS COME INTO THE WORLD, AND MEN LOVED DARKNESS RATHER THAN (or instead of) LIGHT, BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS (or actions) WERE EVIL (or wicked). FOR EVERY ONE THAT DOETH EVIL (things) HATETH THE LIGHT (hates Jesus and God's Word), NEITHER COMETH TO THE LIGHT (which is Jesus), (he-avoids it) (for fear) LEST HIS DEEDS (or actions) SHOULD BE REPROVED (or exposed). BUT HE THAT DOETH (or lives by or practices the) TRUTH (or does what is true) COMETH TO THE LIGHT, (which is Jesus), THAT HIS DEEDS (or actions) MAY BE MADE MANIFEST (or seen plainly), THAT THEY ARE WROUGHT (or accomplished or done) IN GOD-Jn 3:19-21. 18-THE CONCLUSION A born-again person does not practice sin. If a person claims to be saved, but practices sin, they are a liar. They are not born-again. It is written, WHOSOEVER ABIDETH (or lives) IN HIM SINNETH NOT (or no one who remains united with Him continues sinning-JNT): WHOSOEVER (or everyone who does continue) (to sin) (or) SINNETH HATH NOT SEEN HIM, NEITHER KNOWN HIM. HE THAT COMMITTETH SIN (or practices sin) (or keeps on sinning); IS OF THE DEVIL; FOR THE DEVIL SINNETH FROM THE BEGINNING. FOR THIS PURPOSE THE SON OF GOD WAS MANIFESTED (or appeared), THAT HE MIGHT DESTROY THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL. WHOSOEVER IS BORN OF GOD (or has God as his Father) DOTH NOT COMMIT SIN (or practices sin) (or keeps on sinning) FOR HIS SEED (the seed planted by God) REMAINETH IN HIM: AND HE CANNOT SIN, BECAUSE HE IS BORN OF GOD (he has God as his Father)-1 Jn 3:6,8,9.\n\nEaster Sunday: Giveaway Winner Announcement - Pupp...

      "Model_input": "Who did Etting live with when her mother died?\n\nPAGLIN: Really. Why was that? MATTHEWS: Well, I think the emphasis when I was a kid was more on my mother's side of the family. Those were the relatives who lived near us. My father's relatives were either dead or lived in another state. Except for his sister who went on in her later years to marry retired Senator Flanders in Vermont, his second wife. We didn't see a lot of that side of the family. PAGLIN: Did she move to Vermont? MATTHEWS: Yeah, she was in her 60s or 70s at that point. PAGLIN: Your father died when you were quite young. MATTHEWS: Yes, it was a terrible thing. He died on V.J. day 1945, the whole world was celebrating the end of the war and my mother's husband died. He had a severe ulcer for many years that he hid from my mother. PAGLIN: Stomach ulcers. MATTHEWS: Yes. And it exploded on him and he went to the hospital and two days later he died. In those days I'm not sure they could have saved him, but they didn't have the microsurgery techniques that they have now. PAGLIN: How old was he? MATTHEWS: He was 48 years old. PAGLIN: A young man. MATTHEWS: My mother lived to be 93. Never remarried. PAGLIN: While your father was in business what was his line?\n\nMy peace did not last long. One night I had a horrible dream that my mom left me. I was crying and I couldn't stop. I cried for such a long time that I woke my mother. I told her what I had dreamt. She said that she would never leave me. Weeks passed, and then my nightmare came true. My mother died of a stroke. I blame my dad because of the injuries he gave her. Thinking about it now, I hate him. I wish I could have done something. But when I saw my mother collapse, time passed so quickly I didn't know what to do. I was only eight! The day my mother died, I didn't cry because I didn't know what death was. I did cry when they buried her. I knew at that moment that I would never see her again. After my mother died, one of my aunts took me in. She was very poor, just like my mother. She was mean, and I think she was mad that she had to take care of me, but I had nowhere else to go. One day the man who had brought the pictures of my baby brother came to visit again. It had taken him a long time to find us because I had moved. He was sad to hear that my mother had died. Then he gave me new clothes, a doll, and more pictures of my brother. My aunt asked him if the family who adopted my brother would want to adopt me too. The man turned to me and asked if I wanted to go live with my brother in the United States. Even though I didn't know what to expect, I said yes. He said he would find out if it was possible. I waited for what seemed like forever. I started to think that maybe the American family did not want me.\n\nMary Mother Of Jesus Blog Apologetics Jesus Christianity Love Daily Living Marriage End Times Paganism Evangelism Relationships Faith Salvation Gifts Sin Mary Mother Of Jesus Mary, the mother of Jesus, lived to be how old? Join Our Christian Friendship and Take The Who Is Mary Bible Quiz ---Maggie on 4/23/07 Helpful Blog Vote (9) I often wonder about Mary - how old was she when she had Jesus, what became of her after He died, etc. I think if these things were relevant, they'd be in the Bible. It's not important for us to know these things - is it? To me, what is most important is the message of our Savior. ---Amanda on 12/4/07 As fgar as Im aware, the Assumption of the BVM did not become official RCC doctrine till about 1850. I was not aware that it was an Orthodox doctrine. Mind you, Pope Jack is a mind all of his own. As to the assumption, where was she buried when it happened? One tradition is she died in Jeruslem, anther places her in Ephesus. ---mike8384 on 4/29/07 Jack - Are you trying to say that Mary had a special rapture all of her own? That is what is going to happen to all Christians who have died in Christ. They will be raptured out of the grave. As I have said before and keep on saying, that is unique RCC doctrine, which means that you are believing the lies of the RCC.\n\nPK: Well, did you get to know any of these people yourself, personally, or more"

I've never read any Ali Smith, although I've heard many people speak approvingly of her work; Autumn even looks like it might be genre. I keep an eye open for McCarthy's novels when I find them, so Suttree was a happy find. And while I can take or leave Clarke, The Ghost from the Grand Banks is about underwater exporation, so it'll be interesting seeing what Sir Arthur made of it. I'm not sure how to describe this one. I found it on eBay, from a German seller, and since I'm a fan of James Benning's films I couldn't resist it. Although titled (FC) Two Cabins by JB, it seems to include essays on other works by Benning and not just that one. I didn't pay anywhere near the price currently being asked on Amazon...

      "Model_input": "Besides Hamilcar Barca, what do other leaders think of the commander of the Punic Wars?\n\nBarca ( Punic :, BRQ ) was the Semitic surname of his aristocratic family, meaning \"shining\" or \"lightning\". [8] It is thus the Phoenician equivalent to the Arabic name Barq or the Hebrew name Barak or the ancient Greek epithet Keraunos, which was commonly given to military commanders in the Hellenistic period. [9] In English, his clan are sometimes collectively known as the Barcids. As with Greek and Roman practice, patronymics were a common part of Carthaginian nomenclature, so that Hannibal would also have been known as \"Hannibal son of Hamilcar\". [10] Background and early career [ edit ] A Carthaginian coin depicting Hasdrubal Barca (245-207 BC), one of Hannibal's younger brothers, wearing a diadem A Carthaginian shekel, dated 237-227 BC, depicting the Punic god Melqart (equivalent of Hercules / Heracles ), most likely with the features of Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal Barca; on the reverse is a man riding an elephant A quarter shekel of Carthage, perhaps minted in Spain; the obverse may depict Hannibal with the traits of a young Melqart ; the reverse features one of his famous war elephants. [11] Hannibal was one of the sons of Hamilcar Barca, a Carthaginian leader. He was born in what is present day northern Tunisia, one of many Mediterranean regions colonised by the Canaanites from their homelands in Phoenicia. He had several sisters and two brothers, Hasdrubal and Mago. His brothers-in-law were Hasdrubal the Fair and the Numidian king Naravas. He was still a child when his sisters married, and his brothers-in-law were close associates during his father's struggles in the Mercenary War and the Punic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. In light of Hamilcar Barca's cognomen, historians refer to Hamilcar's family as the Barcids. However, there is debate as to whether the cognomen Barca (meaning \"thunderbolt\") was applied to Hamilcar alone or was hereditary within his family. If the latter, then Hannibal and his brothers also bore the name \"Barca\".

Hamilcar Barca began this conquest from his base at Cadiz by conquering the Tartessian Guadalquivir river region, which was rich in silver. After Hamilcar's death, his son-in-law Hasdrubal continued his incursions into Iberia, founding the colony of Qart Hadasht (modern Cartagena ) and extending his influence all the way to the southern bank of the river Ebro.

      "Model_answer": "The Florida Department of Law Enforcement concluded that Dunn's death was a homicide caused by a single gunshot wound to the chest.",
      "Model_input": "What were the circumstances of Dunn's death?\n\nSuch a killing would be justifiable homicide in self-defense, if the defendant reasonably believed himself to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury. As our United States Supreme Court has often said, reasonableness depends on the \"totality of the circumstances.\" We know from Dunn's letters that he regarded the four boys as dangerous thugs and gangsters listening to \"thug\" music. That is a racist assumption unsupported by any evidence. Sometimes people see what they expect to see or want to see and that certainly applies to racists who are substantially more likely to assume that an unarmed black male teenager is an armed thug than an unprejudiced person. Like it or not, that mindset is part of the totality of the circumstances that a jury should have a right to consider in deciding whether a defendant like Dunn gave a truthful account of his actions and acted reasonably. Our legal system needs to acknowledge the existence of racism and call it what it is, an insane delusion. A claim of self-defense must be evaluated according to whether a reasonable person in the same situation as the defendant would have believed himself to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury such that the use of deadly force in self-defense was reasonably necessary. There is no such thing as a reasonable insane delusion and we do justice to no one by excusing a violent act committed by a person pursuant to an insane delusion and ignoring the consequences of that act.\n\nSuch a killing would be justifiable homicide in self-defense, if the defendant reasonably believed himself to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.

Dunn didn't murder them for anything they did, but because who they were. Maybe not if there was a stealth juror. LikeLike Xena | 02/16/2014 at 9:11 pm roderick2012, understand what you're saying but it would have helped nailed down the premeditation part that was needed for the Murder 1 charge, and it would have gone a long way in negating Dunn's lie that he killed because Jordan verbally threatened him. I agree, but there's SYG with language that conveys there's no need to do what is reasonable to avoid confrontation. That law renders murder 1 impotent because it provides for people to remain under circumstances and respond with deadly force. Think of that law -- it says that people don't have the duty to retreat. They can stand and provoke conditions for a second, a minute or longer, then say it wasn't premeditated because the other person was threatening them all the time until they felt they had no choice but to defend themselves. LikeLike roderick2012 | 02/17/2014 at 12:40 pm So basically Corey overcharged and will overcharge again if there is a retrial?\n\nI understand what you're saying but it would have helped nailed down the premeditation part that was needed for the Murder 1 charge, and it would have gone a long way in negating Dunn's lie that he killed because Jordan verbally threatened him.

Inspired by her classical background and artists from Charlie Poole to Puccini, her banjo and banjo ukulele playing proffer equal parts rhythm and ornamentation to projects of varied musical genres, though she has never strayed far from the blood harmonies of groups like the Louvin Brothers and the Boswell Sisters. A founding member of both the Grammy-nominated group Della Mae, and the internationally known oldtime group Bill and the Belles, van't Hof's career has taken her around the world. Now allied with fellow country-duet fanatic Conner Steven Vlietstra, Grace seeks to explore, map, and poke holes in the varied and complicated roles of men and women in early country, bluegrass gospel and old-time music. Of her time with Bill and the Belles, Rolling Stone Magazine said, \"[the band] is committed to helping early country music remain appreciated - not just replicated.\" Conner Steven Vlietstra guitar, banjo, vocals Conner Steven Vlietstra is an Oldtime Country musician from Chattanooga, Tennessee with a family from the Mississippi Delta. He began playing Country Blues music on the guitar at the age of 14 and began playing Country music shortly after with the inheritance of his grandfather's (Papa's) banjo.\n\nGave First Recitals In October 1883, Beach gave her first significant public recital at the Boston Music Hall. For the event, she played Ignaz Moschelese's G Minor Concerto with the orchestra and as a soloist. She also performed Chopin's Rondo in E-flat. Between 1883 and 1885, Beach gave several more recitals in Boston. One of Beach's last public recitals was with the Boston Symphony Orchestra; she played Chopin's F Minor Concerto. In addition to her recitals, she appeared as a soloist with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. For all her public appearances, Beach generally received many positive reviews. Married Dr. Beach On December 2, 1885, Beach was married to Dr. Henry Beach, who was 24 years her elder and a widower. Dr. Beach was a surgeon and professor at Harvard. He had followed her career from the time she was a child in part because he was also a musician, albeit on an amateur level. After the marriage, Beach did not perform in public except for charity functions. Any time she performed, her fees were donated to charity. She did this at the request of her husband, who wanted her to be a wife and not a concert pianist. Upon her marriage, Beach was known publicly as Mrs. H. H. A. Beach. Focused on Composing Dr. Beach did not want his wife to perform, but he did encourage her musical career. It was at his suggestion that she began composing. He did not encourage her to formally study the subject of composition believing that it might inhibit her originality. It was because of these restrictions that Beach became a virtually self-taught composer.\n\nEp 113 - The Unsinkable Mommy Adler Grace prepares in advance for the arrival of her mother, a former showgirl who just loves upstaging her daughter.

Ep 410 - A Movable Feast (Part II) The Thanksgiving episode concludes with what Will calls \"real dysfunction\": dinner with his nettling mother and other Truman relatives. Ep 308 - Lows in the Mid-Eighties (Part I) In a flashback to Thanksgiving 1985, coed Grace invites her college boyfriend Will home to meet her family, but their romantic relationship swerves when a conflicted Will phones a teenaged Jack for some crucial advice. Ep 309 - Lows in the Mid-Eights (Part II) The conclusion of a flashback to a memorable Thanksgiving in 1985 reveals how Will and Jack became pals; and how Karen ended up with hubby Stan.

In the public records context, the Ohio Supreme Court has interpreted the open records statute, in this decision, to say that if the records are produced before the end of the litigation, no attorneys fees are to be awarded under the Ohio statute. Now, the Ohio statute does not say that, but... it does now. In the open meetings context, this decision (for Hamilton County) and this decision (for Butler, Clermont and Warren Counties) say that \"discussions\" do not have to be in public, but \"deliberations\" do. The judicial districts in Ohio disagree on this standard, and the Ohio Supreme Court has declined to clarify the issue. Thus, that distinction between discussions and deliberations is also not in the statute, but... it is now. This article addressing frustrations with judicial interpretations of the state of Michigan open meetings laws shows that Courts in other states have managed to muddy the waters as well. In short, most states have fairly clear open meetings and public records laws. It is up to the Courts to determine if we get to keep them. Related By Christopher P.

The university has said the law firm's work included determining what Ohio State and its leaders knew during Strauss' tenure. But the independence of the investigation has been questioned by some of Strauss' accusers, including some of the lawsuit plaintiffs, their attorneys and the whistleblower who helped to spur the investigation last spring. Ohio State has sought to have the lawsuits thrown out as being time-barred by law, but university leaders have insisted they're not ignoring the men's stories. The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights also is examining whether Ohio State responded \"promptly and equitably\" to students' complaints. Strauss, a well-regarded physician and sports-medicine researcher, killed himself in 2005. No one has publicly defended him, though his family has said they were shocked at the allegations. Like the school, they said they were seeking the truth about him. Employment records shared by Ohio State reflect no major concerns about Strauss before he retired in 1998. But alumni said they complained as early as the late 1970s, and Ohio State has at least one documented complaint from 1995. The State Medical Board of Ohio said it never disciplined Strauss but acknowledged having confidential records about the investigation of a complaint involving him. Records of board communications indicate Ohio State reported Strauss to the medical board at some point but include no details.\n\nNow, I see a 'State Tax Lien' record filed against my name by Ohio in February 2016. I never lived in Ohio but have used a friend's address there for my credit cards. This is because I didn't want to close my Credit Cards as I saw a possibility for going to USA again. Is there an option to dispute this record online since I have never lived in Ohio state? Could there be any chance that this was put by mistake? I still find it hard to believe that the state authorities took my credit card address as a proof of residence. If there is no option to dispute, what is the worst that can happen if I don't pay it and enter the US in 2020? united-states income-tax state-income-tax ohio share|improve this question edited Jun"

      "Model_input": "Who was Skye Keibler's tag team?\n\nOn-screen relationships (2002-2003) [ edit ] Keibler was originally drafted to the SmackDown! brand in 2002, [46] where her character showed an interest in becoming the personal assistant to WWE chairman, then-heel, Vince McMahon. [8] McMahon was ready to hire another attractive female until Keibler interrupted and performed a table dance in the ring. [44] Keibler became McMahon's personal assistant, [8] as well as his on-screen mistress. She was frequently shown flirting and'making out' with him in backstage segments, until Stephanie McMahon became general manager of the SmackDown! brand. [47] [48] Then-babyface, Dawn Marie made her debut on SmackDown! as McMahon's legal assistant, who competed with Keibler for McMahon's affections. [49] A key storyline for Keibler's on-screen character occurred when she left SmackDown! for Raw. Keibler made her official Raw debut on August 12, 2002. For the remainder of 2002 and most of 2003, Keibler was paired with her real-life boyfriend at the time, Test. As Test's on-screen marketing agent, she came up with the idea that Test should call his fans \"Testicles,\" cut his hair, and reshape his image. [50] [51] The couple were originally villains but due to popularity of the gimmick, they became fan favorites. In the spring of 2003, Test, however, became to verbally abuse Keibler, who also started managing Scott Steiner. After months of build-up, Keibler finally left Test for Steiner on the June 2 edition of Raw. [52] Steiner defeated Test for Keibler's services at Bad Blood, and Keibler seemed happy as Steiner's new manager, as the two alluded to having more than a professional relationship. [53] Test, however, continued to harass Keibler and Steiner until Steiner accepted a rematch with Stacy's services on the line. On the August 18 episode of Raw, Test won the match after faking a leg injury and then blindsiding Steiner with a big boot. A match was then set for Unforgiven with the stipulation that if Test won, he would not only retain Keibler's services, [37] but would acquire Steiner's services as well. During the match, Keibler's interference backfired, and Test won the match. [54] Steiner then turned heel by attacking Keibler after her interference in his match on the September 29 episode of Raw backfired. [55] For a time, Test and Steiner worked as a tag team, sharing the services of Keibler as their on-screen sex slave. [37] The storyline finally ended on the December 1 episode of Raw, when general manager Mick Foley freed Keibler from her obligatory contracts with Test and Steiner by temporarily firing them. [56]\n\nVarious storylines (2003-2005) [ edit ] Keibler was chosen to record a track on the album WWE Originals. She and WWE music producer Jim Johnston recorded the song \"Why Can't We Just Dance?\" for the album. [57] She was then placed in a feud involving Torrie Wilson and then-babyface, Sable, both of whom had recently posed for a Playboy cover. Keibler aligned with Miss Jackie, neither of whom had posed for the magazine, claiming that they deserved to be in Playboy over Sable and Wilson. [58] Keibler and Jackie challenged Sable and Wilson to a Tag Team Evening Gown match at WrestleMania XX, which they lost when Jackie was pinned by Wilson, and the feud was dropped afterward. Before the feud was dropped, all the performers were playing face characters at the time. [59] Keibler wrestling Trish Stratus during a house show in October 2004 She took over the 2004 Raw Diva Search for a few weeks, which led to several tag matches against the heel gimmicks of Gail Kim, Trish Stratus, and Molly Holly and with partners Nidia and the face gimmick of Victoria. [11] Keibler got upset victories over Kim, Stratus, and Holly. [11] She earned a Women's Championship title match on October 11, 2004, but she was defeated by Stratus, who retained the title. [11] [60] Keibler also competed in the first-ever Fulfill your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal for the WWE Women's Championship at Taboo Tuesday along with Victoria, Nidia, Gail Kim, Molly Holly, Jazz, and then-champion Stratus. [59] She was eliminated second to last after jumping over the top rope to avoid hitting the turnbuckle, followed by Holly knocking her off the apron to eliminate her. [59]\n\nIn February 2005, Keibler began appearing in backstage segments with then-babyface, Randy Orton, and eventually became his on-screen girlfriend.

      "Model_input": "What was the 1985 album of the same name?\n\nDuring 1984, LaBelle managed to make another duet. This time, her partner was Bobby Womack and the song's name was \"Love Has Finally Come at Last\". The same year Patti starred in the film A Soldier's Story, where she had a role of club singer. Also, in 1984, Patti made a soundtrack for Beverly Hills Cop, the Eddie Murphy's film. She sang two songs, \"Stir It Up\" and \"New Attitude\". \"New Attitude\" was also one of her solo hits and it managed to become the 17th hit on Billboard Hot 100. In 1985, Patti La Belle was a part of Live Aid, and in the same year she showed in Motown Returns to Apollo, a popular TV special. These two performances made Patti very popular, becoming a pop star, and because of this, she was made a host of the television special, also in 1985. In the same year, she released a video of her 1985 tour, on VHS. During this year, Patti left Philadelphia International and signed the contract with MCA Records. For this music company, she released her solo album Winner in You, which was one of her best-selling albums. With this album, Patti managed to find herself on the top of the pop charts. \"On My Own\" was a hit song from this album and it soon became an international hit. Also, on this album, there was a ballad named \"Oh People\".\n\nSome sessions were produced by Trevor Horn (who had been the Yes singer on the Drama album and tour, in 1980) and an album was prepared. In the final stages of production, the name Cinema was discarded when Jon Anderson was invited to sing and Yes was, again and unintentionally, reborn. Kaye was absent for the latter part of the 90125 recording sessions, so Rabin played some keyboards in the recorded songs as well. He was also absent in the video for \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" (replaced by Eddie Jobson), but returned to the sessions before the resulting album was released. That album was 90125, the top-selling album by the band (including its only Number One single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", as well as the track \"Cinema\", which was awarded a Grammy as Best Instrumental), and the tour that followed was the best grossing ever for the group, ending in February 1985 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In January 1985 Yes played in front of hundreds of thousands of fans at the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro (and transmitted live all over the world). An EP, 9012Live and a couple of singles were all the live material that was released from this successful tour, but a video of the same name was a commercial success and was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nSo what happened to some of the other \"Filthy 15?\" Vanity, for her part, never quite had the career that she might have had if she had stayed under Prince's tutelage (she was supposed to be the female lead in Purple Rain, but had a falling out with Prince before filming began; the role would then fall to another Prince acolyte, Apollonia). The album that her PMRC greatest hit appeared on, Wild Animal, wasn't exactly memorable and, in 1985, she posed for Playboy. In the early 1990s, she shed the stage name Vanity (returning to her birth name), found Christianity and became a minister. Regarding her days as \"Vanity,\" she said to Rolling Stone, \"I was young and irresponsible, a silly woman laden with sin, not caring for anything except fame and fortune and self.\" The same is also true for Blackie Lawless, the founder and leader of W.A.S.P. Their song \"Animal (Fuck Like a Beast)\" was one of the biggest bombshells of the PMRC and Lawless' photograph - of him with a circular saw blade protruding from his groin as he played bass onstage - was waved frequently during the hearings in Washington, D. C. in 1985. Lawless, however, now is a born-again Christian and states that he hasn't played the song - either live or otherwise - in more than a decade.\n\nClannad in 1982 at the Leeds Folk Festival In 1985, Clannad released Macalla (Irish for Echo ) which was recorded in Switzerland, England, and Ireland. It contained all original material except one traditional song and yielded the group a hit single \" In a Lifetime \", a duet with U2 singer Bono which begins with Maire being heard teaching Gaelic to Bono during the introduction. [22] The album features numerous backing musicians who have continued to tour with them, including ex- King Crimson saxophonist Mel Collins, Moving Hearts'guitarist Anthony Drennan, and drummer Paul Moran. Also on board was producer Steve Nye, who oversaw the pop-flavoured \" Closer to Your Heart \" and the ballad \" Almost Seems (Too Late to Turn) \" and became hit singles, the latter serving as the"

It owns publishing rights, controls its samples and has 90% influence over its career. And that control, that outlook for the future, is what makes it the best.\" [45] Wu-Tang Clan have produced four subsequent group albums since Enter the Wu-Tang, including Wu-Tang Forever (1997), which is certified as a quadruple platinum record. [46] None of the subsequent Wu-Tang Clan albums have garnered the critical accolades that their debut was accorded. [47] In 2013, the group reunited, at the behest of RZA, for an album and tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of the album's release. [48] The album was titled A Better Tomorrow and the tour included dates throughout the United States, Europe, and Russia.

Several Wu affiliates have come out in support of Drake's homage and there have been reports that a remix featuring some of the Clan is on the way. Now resident Wu producer RZA reveals that he actually played an important role in \"Wu-tang Forever\" being finalized. [ALSO CHECK OUT: Drake \"Wu-Tang Forever\"] \"[Drake] sent me [the] song because they couldn't clear the sample. So I did it myself, personally, for free. Free of charge,\" RZA told Rolling Stone. The 4th track on Drake's third album was inspired by Wu-Tang Clan's \"It's Yourz\" off the New York rap collective's 1997 double album Wu-Tang Forever. \"To me, that's what we meant when we said 'Wu-Tang is forever.' We didn't think we were going to live forever. We meant that the energy of what we do would spread on in culture, generation by generation,\" added RZA. \"By Drake absorbing it and having that influence in his life and having it be a part of him, it proves what I'm saying.\"\n\n \"Wu&A: The RZA on Enter the Wu-Tang 20 Years Later and Who's Holding Up the Wu's Reunion Album - Hollywood Prospectus Blog\".

Since releasing their last album in 1974, the legendary glam rock band has played reunion shows only sporadically, and never outside of Europe. But this spring the band will tour the United States for the first time in 45 years, and that eight-date tour will kick off in Milwaukee on April 1 at the Miller High Life Theatre. According to a press release, \"The tour, featuring core '74 members Ian Hunter, Ariel Bender and Morgan Fisher, celebrates the 45th anniversary of their famous 1974 U.S. tour, as well as the original release of The Hoople and Live, the final albums of the classic Mott The Hoople era.\" The band's original bassist, Pete Overend Watts, and drummer, Dale \"Buffin\" Griffin, passed away in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and keyboardist Mick Ralphs is no longer able to tour with the band because of health issues, so this tour will join veteran members Hunter, Bender and Fisher with James Mastro (guitar, saxophone, mandolin), Steve Holley (drums, backing vocals), Mark Bosch (guitar), Paul Page (bass) and Dennis Dibrizzi (keyboards, backing vocals).\n\nConcert: Queen live at the Exposition Hall, Portland, ME, USA [28.04.1974] [QueenConcerts] QueenConcerts Concertography Queen Brian May Roger Taylor Freddie Mercury John Deacon The Cross Find a concert...

Ian Hunter was center front, and Luther \"Ariel Bender\" Grosvenor strode stage left like a rock superhero; his wide-legged stance every inch reeked of a Jack Kirby \"Thor\" panel as he was having a great time of this. The live sound was, thank goodness, superb. The over amped sound of The Dream Syndicate was just a bad memory by now. All of this sounded wonderful and the sold out auditorium was eating this up with a spoon. The second song out of the gate threw me for a loop. The band delivered \"Lounge Lizard\" from Hunter's solo debut album with all of the requisite sass it needed. I had imagined up front that there would be no dipping into the Hunter solo era, so this served to put that idea to bed straight away. Then another helping of \"The Hoople\" was delivered with the streetwise boogie of \"Alice.\" Boogie of a second kind was what \"Honaloochie Boogie\" from \"Mott\" trafficked in, then the performed a song that I didn't recognize. This show was all about the 45th anniversary of 1974 and the set leaned heavily on the tour from that year \"Rest In Peace\" was not from any Mott studio album. It was only on the \"Mott The Hoople Live\" album from their '74 tour, which was the other stated blueprint from this era of the band that laid the foundation of this show. Impressive attention to detail! I next got to hear an all time favorite from \"Mott\" that I first heard on Ian Hunter's \"Welcome To The Club;\" possibly my favorite"

At the time, she said the show made girls out to be mean, that it was dis-empowering for girls. Seems to me the girls have all the power on that show - and occasionally learn lessons about wielding that power that don't come delivered by sledgehammer. It's irreverent, soapy, silly and - oh yeah - fun. That, to me, is Betty's missing ingredient. posted by Jen @ 12:01 p.m. 0 comments Your Superbowl Primer For you casual fans who are heading to Superbowl parties this Sunday-and are anxious to avoid the withering stares of superfans who deride your lack of football knowledge - herein is a primer on the big stories of the day. Unload some of this knowledge on your buddies, to ensure that your contribution to the discussion is something other than \"Hey, that Palomolive guy for Pittsburgh sure has some awesome hair\" and \"When is the Budwesier commercial with those cute horses coming on?\" The Backstory On Arizona: They have a long a glorious history of sucking. A lot. Every damn year. Affectionately known as The Buzzsaw that is the Arizona Cardinals (so dubbed by Will Leitch, former editor of Deadspin.com), the Cardinals are known for being a really mediocre team over the really long term. They've been around in one incarnation or another since 1898, and have never been to the Superbowl (though they won a championships in the pre-Superbowl era -in 1947 -back when they were still the Chicago Cardinals). After Chicago, they moved to St. Louis, where they sucked. They then moved on to Arizona in the 1980s where, you guessed it, they sucked. The most famous Cardinal of the Arizona era is unquestionably Pat Tilman, who gave up his NFL career to become an Army Ranger in the days after 911 and died in Afghanistan. For Arizona, even getting to big game was improbable. They've played well, but are here at least in part because Carolina QB Jake Delhomme did the best Brett Favre impression ever a few weeks back.\n\n25. Arizona Cardinals The Cardinals' record this year will not reflect the talent of this team because the division they are in is so good. But much like the Chiefs, the fact that even a competent quarterback is under center instead of the train wreck of last year is a big jump. However, the Chiefs have a great offensive line while the Cardinals are the complete opposite. Arizona's defense is top notch, and will keep them in a lot of games and not force Carson Palmer to play above his talent level. 26. Tennessee Titans As we get to the bottom feeders of the NFL, you start to see a pattern. Much like the Panthers, this team has some bad contracts. Chris Johnson is a good running back, but I can assure you he's not worth $13 million a year. The Shonn Greene signing was just an atrocious decision, excuse me because I just threw up my lunch thinking about it. I like Jake Locker as a QB, but he'll never be anything more than a league average signal caller. 27. Cleveland Browns Surprisingly, Brandon Weeden had a pretty good end of the year last year. I'm not trying to vouch for him, because anytime you can draft a 29 year old quarterback in the first round you have to pull the trigger (kidding). Regardless, they're under new management and are off to a solid start. They admittedly overpaid for Paul Kruger; but when you are the Browns you don't have much say in free agents to start rebuilding with.\n\nAtlanta Falcons Signed: RB Blake Sims (link via Matt Zenitz of AL.com) Cut: RB Gus Johnson (Twitter link via Aaron Wilson of The Houston Chronicle) Arizona Cardinals Signed: WR Marquis Bundy (via team announcement) Cut: WR Chris Hubert (Twitter link via Aaron Wilson of The Houston Chronicle) Chicago Bears Signed: RB/KR Raheem Mostert (Twitter link via agent Brett Tessler) Cut: RB Senorise Perry (Twitter link via Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune), OL Laurence Gibson (Twitter link via Biggs) Dallas Cowboys Signed: CB Sammy Seamster (Twitter link via Todd Archer of ESPN.com) Denver Broncos Signed: LB Reshard Cliett (Twitter link via Wilson) Cut: LB Kyle Kragen (Twitter link via Cameron Wolfe of The Denver Post) Indianapolis Colts: Signed: CB Tay Glover-Wright (Twitter link via Wilson), S Lee Hightower (Twitter link via Wilson) Cut: DT Kelcy Quarles, OL Adam Redmond (Twitter link via Wilson) Jacksonville Jaguars Cut: WR Shaq Evans (Twitter link via Michael DiRocco of ESPN.com) Minnesota Vikings Signed: CB Tre Roberson, CB Julian Wilson (via team announcement)"

      "Model_input": "When did Blanche DuBois die?\n\nAfter 326 performances, Leigh finished her run, and she was soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in the film version of the play. [Note 4] Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Brando, but she had an initial difficulty in working with director Elia Kazan, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. [87] Kazan had favoured Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche. [86] He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that \"she had a small talent.\" As work progressed, however, he became \"full of admiration\" for \"the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance.\" Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the Los Angeles Times, \"I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me.\" [88] Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler's Carrie (1952). Leigh's performance in A Streetcar Named Desire won glowing reviews, as well as a second Academy Award for Best Actress, [89] a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. [90] Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role \"everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of\". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois \"tipped me over into madness\".

Blanche's brother-in-law, a macho working-class guy named Stanley Kowalski, is so filled with class resentment that he seeks to destroy Blanche's character in New Orleans as well. His cruelty, combined with Blanche's fragile, insecure personality, leaves her mentally detached from reality by the play's end. rising action * Blanche immediately rouses the suspicion of Stanley, who (wrongly) suspects Blanche of swindling Stella out of her inheritance. Blanche grows to despise Stanley when she sees him drunkenly beat her pregnant sister. Stanley permanently despises Blanche after he overhears her trying to convince Stella to leave Stanley because he is common. Already suspicious of Blanche's act of superiority, Stanley researches Blanche's past. He discovers that in Laurel Blanche was known for her sexual promiscuity and for having an affair with a teenage student. He reports his findings to Blanche's suitor, Mitch, dissuading Mitch from marrying Blanche.\n\nRelated Characters: Blanche DuBois (speaker), Stella Kowalski Related Symbols: The Streetcar Related Themes: Page Number and Citation: 81 Cite this Quote Explanation and Analysis: Unlock with LitCharts A+ Don't-don't hang back with the brutes!

Such is the case of WebTV, the set-top device that allowed you to surf a television-optimized version of the web. On September 18, 1996--20 years ago this week--a startup firm released a device that meant to bring the internet to the living room. It was a bet that people didn't want to use a computer set up at a desk to get online--a bet that turned out to be half-right, because ultimately people didn't want to be tethered at all.

      "Model_input": "who is next President if vice president dies or becomes incapacitated?\n\nIf a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated between the general election and the meeting of electors, under federal law, the electors pledged to the deceased candidate may vote for the candidate of their choice at the meeting of electors. Individual states may pass laws on the subject, but no federal law proscribes how electors must vote when a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated. In 1872, when Horace Greeley passed away between election day and the meeting of electors, the electors who were slated to vote for Greeley voted for various candidates, including Greeley. The votes cast for Greeley were not counted due to a House resolution passed regarding the matter. See the full Electoral College vote counts for President and Vice President in the 1872 election. As to a candidate who dies or becomes incapacitated between the meeting of electors and the counting of electoral votes in Congress, the Constitution is silent on whether this candidate meets the definition of \"President elect\" or \"Vice President elect.\" If the candidate with a majority of the electoral votes is considered \"President elect,\" even before the counting of electoral votes in Congress, Section 3 of the 20th Amendment applies. Section 3 of the 20th Amendment states that the Vice President elect will become President if the President elect dies or becomes incapacitated. If a winning Presidential candidate dies or becomes incapacitated between the counting of electoral votes in Congress and the inauguration, the Vice President elect will become President, according to Section 3 of the 20th Amendment.\n\nThe line of succession follows the order of: vice president, speaker of the House of Representatives, president pro tempore of the Senate, and then the eligible heads of federal executive departments who form the president's Cabinet. The Presidential Succession Act refers specifically to officers beyond the vice president acting as president rather than becoming president when filling a vacancy. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the Secretary of State is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order of when their departments (or the department of which their department is the successor) were created. Those heads of department who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the president through succession, and skipped to the next in line. Since 1789, the vice president has succeeded to the presidency intra-term on nine occasions, eight times due to the incumbent's death, and once due to resignation. No one lower in the line of succession has been called upon to act as president. Widely considered a settled issue during the late 20th century, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 demonstrated the potential for a decapitation strike that would kill or incapacitate multiple individuals in the presidential line of succession in addition to many members of Congress and the federal judiciary. In the years immediately following the attacks, there were numerous wide-ranging discussions in Congress, among academics and within the public policy community about continuity of government concerns including the existing constitutional and statutory provisions governing presidential succession. These discussions remain ongoing. One effort put forward by the Continuity of Government Commission, a nonpartisan think tank, produced three reports (2003, 2009 and 2011), the second of which focused on the implicit ambiguities and limitations in the current succession act, and contained recommendations for amending the laws for succession to the presidency.\n\nThe 25th Amendment, Section 1, clarifies Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, by stating unequivocally that the vice president is the direct successor of the president, and becomes president if the incumbent dies, resigns or is removed from office. It also, in sections 3 and 4, provides for situations where the president is temporarily disabled, such as if the president has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally unfit, establishing procedures whereby the vice president can become acting president. Additionally, in Section 2, the amendment provides a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession, establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress. [D] Previously, whenever a vice president had succeeded to the presidency or had died or resigned from office, the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began; there were 16 such vacancies prior to 1967. [15] Further information: Vice President of the United States SS Vacancies Succession acts [ edit ] Main article: Presidential Succession Act Act of 1792 [ edit ] The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 ( Full text ) provided for succession to the presidency, in the event both the office of the President and the Vice President were vacant, by, first, the president pro tempore of the Senate, followed by, if need be, the speaker of the House. [16] Various framers of the Constitution, such as James Madison, criticized the arrangement as being contrary to their intent. The decision to build the line of succession around those two officials was made after a long and contentious debate. In addition to the president pro tempore and the speaker, both the secretary of state and the chief justice of the Supreme Court were also suggested. Including the secretary of state was unacceptable to most Federalists, who"

The underlying assumption of this statement is that, no matter what happens, technology can, and will, save us. There are a few assumptios that I will speak to in this Weekly today. All of them are part of the top assumptions Dana Meadows relayed are made by society that keep getting us into trouble. I share them here below: Technology can solve any problem that comes up. There is no cost to technology, no delay in attaining it, and no confusion about what kind of technology is needed. Improvements will come with better technology, not better humanity. The future is to be predicted, not chosen or created. It happens to us, we do not shape it. People are basically bad, greedy and not to be trusted. Good people and good actions are rare exceptions. We know what we are doing. Technologies are usually declared as 'neutral', no matter the inherent biases in their shaping and development. The markets decide what kind of technologies are created. They inform technological development. These are dictated solely by profit: investors put their money in technologies that, in their opinion, could scale up and have good returns on investment. Making the world a better place does not form part of that equation. We need to remember to ask ourselves the question, who and what does technology currently serve? Technology thus does not serve better humanity, it serves (mostly) to make money for shareholders.\n\nTaking the Plunge and Listening to your Heart does have its Advantages! - QUIKRPOST Home Discover Technology Science Gadgets Wearables Apps Internet How To Blogging Career Discounts-Deals QUIKRPOST Discover 0 Taking the Plunge and Listening to your Heart does have its Advantages! by Rajesh Sharma * April 27, 2015 life of some inspirational people to motivate you Are you in constant fight to whether follow your heart or go by what your rational mind say.

Mother Teresa, from a Convent Teacher to Beacon of Humanity If there is one name you definitely identify in serving humanity, than it will be Mother Teresa. Born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje, Macedonia, was youngest of the three siblings in her family. At the age of 12, she decided to be a missionary and serve the humanity. At 18, she left her parental home and joined Sisters of Loreto in India. Mother teresa the lady with who worked for the poor Mother Teresa taught geography and catechism at St. Mary's High School in Calcutta (now Kolkata) in India. However, she was deeply impacted with the poverty in the town; and in 1948, she left the convent school and devote herself in serving the poorest of poor in slums of Calcutta. Rest is what world knows and recognized. She said, \"Hands that help are holier than lips that pray\". She followed her heart and became the beacon of selfless service to humanity.

Jeff Fitzgerald's well known novel, The Great Gatsby, explores how wealth ultimately causes corruption within a society. In his novel Fitzgerald displays circumstances that may be invoked by the theme; individuals will likely show signs of corruption as they come into wealth. If there is a single character quickly pointed out as showing indications of corruption caused by wealth, it could be Tom Buchanan. Throughout the story nick describes tom because an arrogant character by putting focus on his demeaning manor great inability to respect any individual but him self. Some may argue that Tom's football days and his physical size might add to the arrogant nature connected with Tom.

This wealth has also corrupted Daisy, who keeps with Jeff because of his wealth as well as the lifestyle she gets become familiar with, although Tom treats her very terribly.

The modern Catholic novel, in particular, with its focus on the eternal significance of humanity, deserves this attention.

Scott Fitzgerald's Short-Fiction Treatment Of Religion, Richard W. Halkyard Graduate Theses The intention of my thesis is to reorient the popular vantage points whereby the masses view -- and pigeonhole -- author F. Scott Fitzgerald. Literary critics and cursory readers alike oftentimes fail to see how the writer's foundational Catholic upbringing, and therefore, a religious inclination informed his craft. While Fitzgerald was raised Catholic, few literary critics acknowledge the pattern of religious thematics and imagery Fitzgerald implemented throughout the course of his career. Among those select critics -- including Joan Allen, Alice Hall Petry, and Edward Gillin -- none argue for a positive relationship between Fitzgerald and the Christian God. I assert that Fitzgerald...\n\n"

He slayed the wicked not with a physical sword but with a stern correction that warned of a greater punishment that awaits those who fail to return to God's love. The breath of Yeshua continues to slay the wicked today as it issues from the mouths of those who have received His Spirit. This same breath remains accessible to the humble, firstly and always to the Jew and also always to the nations. \"Therefore I cut them down by the prophets. I slew them by the words of My mouth. Now the judgments pronounced against you: light will go forth.\" -Hosea 6:5 (TLV) Isa 11:5 Vehayah And it comes to pass, tzedek righteousness will be the cloth strapped around mateynayu His waist, vehaemunah and faithfulness, fidelity, trust, firmness, will be the cloth around chalatzayhu His loins. The opening phrase can be read as \"And it has come to pass\", meaning that God sees these things complete outside of time and space. The strapping of the waist and loins is a figurative way of saying, \"He will prepare to battle an adversary\".\n\nSuch as the first words in the song, \"Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play\" and the first words in our first reading, \"I prayed, and prudence was given me? I pleaded, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.\" Calling on the virtue of prudence to be present. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, prudence is the virtue that disposes practical reason to discern our \"true good\" in every circumstance and to choose the right means of achieving it? I remember as a child my mother often reminded me to pray for prudence, as I needed to think before I spoke out loud. When I did, I notice I did not put my foot in my mouth quite as much. In our Gospel, a young, rich man is seeking to inherit eternal life. Jesus tells the man to give up his earthly possessions (his treasure will be in heaven) and follow him. This was something that saddens the man, for he had many possessions he didn't want to give up, and he walked away. Jesus responds, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" What does this mean? Does God need us to be poor in order to inherit eternal life? Are we not allowed to have good things in life? Doesn't God want our happiness? He not only wants our happiness but our Salvation too!\n\nbelieve | Flatlander Faith Accueil About Contact me Memoir Learning Whimsy Flatlander Faith Apologetics from an Anabaptist perspective Home Tag Archives: believe Silence like cancer Leave a comment Posted by Bob Goodnough on October 23, 2019 The fire, the wind, the earthquake beat upon the mountain like hammer blows. Elijah knew God did not speak like that. After all was silent, he heard a gentle voice. It was so soft that he could not discern the words; he went to the mouth of the cave to hear better. God spoke to him in a gentle tone, but did not beat around the bush. His first words were: \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" Jesus often wrapped the truth in a story. His purpose was not to conceal the truth, but to prompt the listeners to search for the meaning, and to make it stick. We should not take the example of Jesus as an excuse to wrap the truth in obscure words which conceal rather than reveal. No one should not have to guess what we are trying to say. When a Pharisee asked Jesus, \"Who is my neighbour?\", Jesus responded with the story we call \"the good Samaritan.\" The Pharisee nodded as Jesus told of the priests who had passed by without helping. That was how he saw the priests. He no doubt expected Jesus to tell how a Pharisee came along and saved the day.\n\nI've always loved the sacramental juiciness of this story. It reminds me of Jesus healing the blind man using mud made from spittle and dust in John 9. I wonder why He sometimes heals with a thought or a word or a simple touch, and sometimes through the use of other matter? In this case, He passes along His spit. How strange. My first thought was that it is like a kiss. A passionate kiss. Spittle is transmitted one of three ways: through a sneeze, through the occasional droplet flung when speaking, or through open mouthed kissing. The first two require a perfect storm of invariably accidental events; the recipient waits with an open"

In 1779, while the American colonies were fighting Britain for their independence, Benjamin Franklin wrote to captains of colonial warships at sea, recommending that if they came into contact with Cook's vessel, they were to \"not consider her an enemy, nor suffer any plunder to be made of the effects contained in her, nor obstruct her immediate return to England by detaining her or sending her into any other part of Europe or to America; but that you treat the said Captain Cook and his people with all civility and kindness... as common friends to mankind.\" [84] The first recorded circumnavigation of the world by an animal was by Cook's goat, [ citation needed ] who made that memorable journey twice [ citation needed ] ; the first time on HMS Dolphin, under Samuel Wallis, and then aboard Endeavour. When they returned to England, Cook had the goat presented with a silver collar engraved with lines from Samuel Johnson : Perpetui, ambita bis terra, praemia lactis Haec habet altrici Capra secunda Jovis. (\"In fame scarce second to the nurse of Jove,/ This Goat, who twice the world had traversed round,/Deserving both her master's care and love,/Ease and perpetual pasture now has found.\" [85] ) She was put to pasture on Cook's farm outside London and was reportedly admitted to the privileges of the Royal Naval Hospital at Greenwich.

But not all raiders were illegal. Early in the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress found itself without an operational navy able to disrupt British shipping and re-supply of the British Army \"redcoats\" in the American Colonies. At the urging of Benjamin Franklin, the Congress approved the issuance of Letters of Marque allowing privateers to raid British ships, and the first ship chosen by Franklin (and according to his correspondence a personal favorite) to receive such a commission was the black-painted and stealthy Black Prince.\n\nThe Santa Maria earned her fame as the flagship of Christopher Columbus on his journey of discovery to the New World in the year 1492, while the Mayflower later transported the Pilgrim settlers to New England where they founded the Plymouth Colony 16"

Gladys cared about Michael enough to tell the world that his daughter was wrong and out of line. On her twitter account, she still defended what she stated and let that be. Emmanuel Lewis (friend) Emmanuel Lewis. Emmanuel Lewis met Michael in the early 1980s when he was on the show Webster. He, along with Brooke Shields accompanied Michael to the 1984 American Music Awards and Grammys. Michael would often go places with Emmanuel and would hang out with his family. During the rough times in Michael's life, Emmanuel has always supported him. He could have been like Corey Feldman and told fables about Michael to the press for publicity but he never did. Instead, he went to college and even ran his own record label. Tom Mesereau (friend) Tom Mesereau. If there was anyone that really know what the word \"friend\" means, that would be Tom Mesereau. I know that I stated on this blog that Randy made a \"mistake\" putting Mesereau in Michael's life after the fact he defended the author Randall Sullivan regarding his book on Michael. At times, I forget that there are reasons why people do what they do and even though I did not agree with Mr. Mesereau's reasons for supporting the book, I do understand. With that said, I would like to take back what I stated about Mr. Mesereau and applaud him for continuing to stand by Michael when low life scum want to destroy his legacy because they did not save up all of the money they made \"choreographing\" lame moves for less than great dancers. Mr. Mesereau have been constantly defending Michael's innocence and his good name to anyone that would listen to him because he knows that he must do that for him. No one asked him to defend Michael and that is the greatness about Mr. Mesereau. His defense of Michael's is effortless, respectable and reasonable. He does not defend Michael halfway but defends him all the way and he does not care how anyone would feel about it.\n\nMore information A Miraculous Announcement Luke 2:1-20 A Miraculous Announcement Luke 2:1-20 Introduction: I.

The San Antonio Spurs are good for an old-fashioned two points and just-put-up-a-basket basketball philosophy has them playing the up-tempo Golden State Warriors. The Warriors are 2-0 in their series against the Spurs and San Antonio doesn't have the basketball personnel to play these Stephen Curry-led basketball team. What will the Spurs do if they can't get back Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker, their two valued starters? The Spurs relied on Leonard having the basketball to dominate the ball game and the Spurs won't play like a team until they realize they have to make shots in order to beat the Warriors. Boston won't defeat Cleveland, because they don't have a superstar like Lebron James who has unmatched athleticism.\n\nAs for the San Antonio Spurs, Kawhi Leonard led the team in scoring with 36 points, LaMarcus Aldridge scored 15 points with 10 boards and David Lee added 10 points for the game. The Spurs failed to set a record of 20 wins for this season after the loss. The Knicks now has a record of 23-33 and will play against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, while the Spurs now are 41-13.
