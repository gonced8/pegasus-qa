      "Model_input": "what was the result of the charge of the light brigade?\n\nof attacking Russia's naval base at the city of Sevastopol and thereby weaken its naval presence in the Black Sea. An artist's conception of the Charge of the Light Brigade Although the war itself is only a dim recollection, what is vividly remembered is one valorously tragic incident of the campaign: the headlong cavalry charge of the British Light Brigade into murderous Russian fire; an action immortalized by Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem. The Charge of the Light Brigade took place during a battle near the city of Balaclava on October 25, 1854. Through a miscommunication of orders, the Light Brigade of approximately 600 horsemen began a headlong charge into a treeless valley with the objective of capturing some Russian field artillery at its end. Unbeknown to them, the valley was ringed on three sides by some 20 battalions of Russian infantry and artillery. The result was disastrous. An estimated 278 of the Light Brigade were killed or wounded. Observing the charge, a French Marshall remarked: \"It is magnificent, but it is not war. It is madness.\" When news of the action reached London, it caused a national scandal that prompted Tennyson to pen his poem. History remembers the charge of the Light Brigade as an example of the extraordinary bravery of the British soldier in the face of enemy fire in spite of poor leadership.\n\n\"The Charge of the Light Brigade was a charge of British cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854 in the Crimean War. The charge was the result of a miscommunication in such a way that the brigade attempted a much more difficult objective than intended by the overall commander Lord Raglan. Blame for the miscommunication has remained controversial, as the original order itself was vague. The charge produced no decisive gains and resulted in very high casualties, and is best remembered as the subject of the poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, whose lines emphasize the valor of the cavalry in carrying out their orders, even \"tho' the soldier knew/Some one had blunder'd\". The charge was made by the Light Brigade of the British cavalry, consisting of the 4th and 13th Light Dragoons, 17th Lancers, and the 8th and 11th Hussars, under the command of Major General the Earl of Cardigan. Together with the Heavy Brigade comprising the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, the 5th Dragoon Guards, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons and the Scots Greys, commanded by Major General James Yorke Scarlett, himself a past Commanding Officer of the 5th Dragoon Guards, the two units were the main British cavalry force at the battle. Overall command of the cavalry resided with Lieutenant General the Earl of Lucan. Cardigan and Lucan were brothers-in-law who disliked each other intensely.\n\nThat's the result of faithfulness to the truth, having no gaps in your armour, standing firm for God in the face of conflict. So, to stand firm for God, you need to be prepared with the armour of truth. The second action we must take is to be prepared with... II. The Armour Of Righteousness Stand therefore...having put on the breastplate of righteousness (14b). The breastplate is the piece of armour that protects the body on every side. If you've ever studied some of the outstanding works of poetry in school, you will know Alfred Lord Tennyson's well known poem about the Balaclava charge of the British to certain death called \"The Charge of the Light Brigade.\" Half a league, half a league, half a league onward, Into the valley of Death rode the six hundred. 'Forward, the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!' he said: Into the valley of Death rode the six hundred. 'Forward, the Light Brigade!' Was there a man dismay'd? Not tho' the soldier knew someone had blunder'd: Their's not to make reply, their's not to reason why, Their's but to do and die: Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred. Cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them, volley'd and thunder'd; Storm'd at with shot and shell, boldly they rode and well,\n\nIn other words, are charge resolutions simultaneous or not? This was important in the game as the French brigade had one bon retreating and a good outcome of the Russian charge would have put the Frech center in falter status Skirmish evading charge A Russian bon charges the extreme left position of a French's brigade skirmish line (see below) According to the book, the French must evade if passing a DT which they successfully completed Question: should the WHOLE skirmish line evade and reposition behind the friendly close order infantry units? This was important because in the firing phase the rest of the Russian brigade could volley fire the packed French close order units Alternatively: can the French skirmish base in the area of the charge"

      "Model_input": "Did Robinson go on to have more Broadway shows after his third one?\n\nIn 1939, Robinson returned to the stage in The Hot Mikado, a jazz version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The show opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Robinson cast in the role of the Emperor. His rendition of My Object All Sublime stopped the show and produced eight encores. After Broadway, the show moved to the 1939 New York World's Fair, and was one of the greatest hits of the fair. August 25, 1939, was named Bill Robinson Day at the fair. [5] : p. 260 Robinson's next Broadway show, All in Fun (1940), was with an all-white cast. Despite having Imogene Coca, Pert Kelton, and other stars, the show received poor reviews at out-of-town tryouts in New Haven and Boston. When the white stars and co-producers, Phil Baker and Leonard Sillman, withdrew, Robinson became the star, the first time an African-American headlined an otherwise all-white production. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about Robinson, they panned the show, and it failed to attract audiences. All in Fun closed after four performances. [5] : pp. 273-275 Robinson's next foray on Broadway was the musical comedy Memphis Bound, which opened in May 1945. This production used an all-black cast including Robinson (who had top billing [15] ), Avon Long, Billy Daniels, Ada Brown, and Sheila Guyse. [16] Robinson played the boat pilot and then Sir Joseph Porter in the play-within-a-play of H.M.S. Pinafore. [17] Critics widely praised Robinson's performance and especially his dancing, [16] [17] [18] with his stair dance cited as a high point of the show. [17]\n\nRobinson's talents transcended his famous Stair Dance by far. The steps themselves were not essential to Robinson's performances; rather, Robinson would naturally shift into \"a little skating step to stop-time; or a Scoot step, a cross-over tap\" or many other tap steps involved in his particular movement quality. [1] : 187 Robinson changed rhythmic meters and tap steps and syncopated breaks seamlessly. Often Robinson would talk to his audience, share anecdotes, and act as if he were surprised by the action of his feet. His amusing personality was essential to his performances and popularity. Robinson is said to have consistently performed in split-soled wooden shoes, handcrafted by a Chicago craftsman. [10] Robinson in The Hot Mikado Broadway [ edit ] In 1928, a white impresario, Lew Leslie, produced Blackbirds of 1928 on Broadway, a black revue for white audiences starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Robinson along with Aida Ward, Tim Moore and other black stars. The show was a huge success on Broadway, where it ran for over one year to sell-out performances. On stage, Adelaide Hall and Robinson danced and sang a duet together, which captivated the audiences. From then on, Robinson's public role was that of a dapper, smiling, plaid-suited ambassador to the white world, maintaining a connection with the black show-business circles through his continuing patronage of the Hoofers Club, an entertainer's haven in Harlem. So successful was Adelaide Hall's collaboration with Bojangles, they even appeared together on stage at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) [11] before they were teamed up together again by Marty Forkins (Robinson's manager) [12] to star in another Broadway musical titled, \"Brown Buddies\", [13] that opened in 1930 at the Liberty Theatre, where it ran for four months before commencing a road tour of the States. [14]\n\nRobinson was a popular figure in both the black and white entertainment worlds of his era. He is best known today for his dancing with Shirley Temple in a series of films during the 1930s, and for starring in the musical Stormy Weather (1943), loosely based on his own life and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. He used his popularity to challenge and overcome numerous racial barriers, including becoming: one of the first minstrel and Vaudeville performers to appear without the use of blackface makeup one of the earliest black performers to go solo, overcoming vaudeville's two-colored rule [2] a headliner in Broadway shows the first black performer to appear in a Hollywood film in an interracial dance team (with Shirley Temple in The Little Colonel, 1935) the first black performer to headline a mixed-race Broadway production Robinson came under heavy criticism for his tacit acceptance of racial stereotypes of the era, with critics calling him an Uncle Tom. He resented such criticism, and his biographers suggested that critics were at best incomplete in making such a characterization, especially given his efforts to overcome racial prejudice. In his public life, Robinson led efforts to: persuade the Dallas Police Department to hire its first black policeman lobby"

Sometimes people see what they expect to see or want to see and that certainly applies to racists who are substantially more likely to assume that an unarmed black male teenager is an armed thug than an unprejudiced person. Like it or not, that mindset is part of the totality of the circumstances that a jury should have a right to consider in deciding whether a defendant like Dunn gave a truthful account of his actions and acted reasonably. Our legal system needs to acknowledge the existence of racism and call it what it is, an insane delusion. A claim of self-defense must be evaluated according to whether a reasonable person in the same situation as the defendant would have believed himself to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury such that the use of deadly force in self-defense was reasonably necessary. There is no such thing as a reasonable insane delusion and we do justice to no one by excusing a violent act committed by a person pursuant to an insane delusion and ignoring the consequences of that act.\n\nSuch a killing would be justifiable homicide in self-defense, if the defendant reasonably believed himself to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.

Dunn didn't murder them for anything they did, but because who they were. Maybe not if there was a stealth juror. LikeLike Xena | 02/16/2014 at 9:11 pm roderick2012, understand what you're saying but it would have helped nailed down the premeditation part that was needed for the Murder 1 charge, and it would have gone a long way in negating Dunn's lie that he killed because Jordan verbally threatened him. I agree, but there's SYG with language that conveys there's no need to do what is reasonable to avoid confrontation. That law renders murder 1 impotent because it provides for people to remain under circumstances and respond with deadly force. Think of that law -- it says that people don't have the duty to retreat. They can stand and provoke conditions for a second, a minute or longer, then say it wasn't premeditated because the other person was threatening them all the time until they felt they had no choice but to defend themselves. LikeLike roderick2012 | 02/17/2014 at 12:40 pm So basically Corey overcharged and will overcharge again if there is a retrial?\n\nI understand what you're saying but it would have helped nailed down the premeditation part that was needed for the Murder 1 charge, and it would have gone a long way in negating Dunn's lie that he killed because Jordan verbally threatened him.

At the time, she said the show made girls out to be mean, that it was dis-empowering for girls. Seems to me the girls have all the power on that show - and occasionally learn lessons about wielding that power that don't come delivered by sledgehammer. It's irreverent, soapy, silly and - oh yeah - fun. That, to me, is Betty's missing ingredient. posted by Jen @ 12:01 p.m. 0 comments Your Superbowl Primer For you casual fans who are heading to Superbowl parties this Sunday-and are anxious to avoid the withering stares of superfans who deride your lack of football knowledge - herein is a primer on the big stories of the day. Unload some of this knowledge on your buddies, to ensure that your contribution to the discussion is something other than \"Hey, that Palomolive guy for Pittsburgh sure has some awesome hair\" and \"When is the Budwesier commercial with those cute horses coming on?\" The Backstory On Arizona: They have a long a glorious history of sucking. A lot. Every damn year. Affectionately known as The Buzzsaw that is the Arizona Cardinals (so dubbed by Will Leitch, former editor of Deadspin.com), the Cardinals are known for being a really mediocre team over the really long term. They've been around in one incarnation or another since 1898, and have never been to the Superbowl (though they won a championships in the pre-Superbowl era -in 1947 -back when they were still the Chicago Cardinals). After Chicago, they moved to St. Louis, where they sucked. They then moved on to Arizona in the 1980s where, you guessed it, they sucked. The most famous Cardinal of the Arizona era is unquestionably Pat Tilman, who gave up his NFL career to become an Army Ranger in the days after 911 and died in Afghanistan. For Arizona, even getting to big game was improbable. They've played well, but are here at least in part because Carolina QB Jake Delhomme did the best Brett Favre impression ever a few weeks back.\n\n25. Arizona Cardinals The Cardinals' record this year will not reflect the talent of this team because the division they are in is so good. But much like the Chiefs, the fact that even a competent quarterback is under center instead of the train wreck of last year is a big jump. However, the Chiefs have a great offensive line while the Cardinals are the complete opposite. Arizona's defense is top notch, and will keep them in a lot of games and not force Carson Palmer to play above his talent level. 26. Tennessee Titans As we get to the bottom feeders of the NFL, you start to see a pattern. Much like the Panthers, this team has some bad contracts. Chris Johnson is a good running back, but I can assure you he's not worth $13 million a year. The Shonn Greene signing was just an atrocious decision, excuse me because I just threw up my lunch thinking about it. I like Jake Locker as a QB, but he'll never be anything more than a league average signal caller. 27. Cleveland Browns Surprisingly, Brandon Weeden had a pretty good end of the year last year. I'm not trying to vouch for him, because anytime you can draft a 29 year old quarterback in the first round you have to pull the trigger (kidding). Regardless, they're under new management and are off to a solid start. They admittedly overpaid for Paul Kruger; but when you are the Browns you don't have much say in free agents to start rebuilding with.\n\nAtlanta Falcons Signed: RB Blake Sims (link via Matt Zenitz of AL.com) Cut: RB Gus Johnson (Twitter link via Aaron Wilson of The Houston Chronicle) Arizona Cardinals Signed: WR Marquis Bundy (via team announcement) Cut: WR Chris Hubert (Twitter link via Aaron Wilson of The Houston Chronicle) Chicago Bears Signed: RB/KR Raheem Mostert (Twitter link via agent Brett Tessler) Cut: RB Senorise Perry (Twitter link via Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune), OL Laurence Gibson (Twitter link via Biggs) Dallas Cowboys Signed: CB Sammy Seamster (Twitter link via Todd Archer of ESPN.com) Denver Broncos Signed: LB Reshard Cliett (Twitter link via Wilson) Cut: LB Kyle Kragen (Twitter link via Cameron Wolfe of The Denver Post) Indianapolis Colts: Signed: CB Tay Glover-Wright (Twitter link via Wilson), S Lee Hightower (Twitter link via Wilson) Cut: DT Kelcy Quarles, OL Adam Redmond (Twitter link via Wilson) Jacksonville Jaguars Cut: WR Shaq Evans (Twitter link via Michael DiRocco of ESPN.com) Minnesota Vikings Signed: CB Tre Roberson, CB Julian Wilson (via team announcement)"

[136] The film was also nominated for 3 Critics' Choice Movie Awards, including Best Comedy. [137] In 2016, Apatow was awarded the Generation Award at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal for his contributions to comedy. [138] In 2018, Apatow was nominated for the Darryl F. Zanuck Award at the Producers Guild Film Awards, alongside producing partner Barry Mendel. Later that year, May It Last: A Portrait Of The Avett Brothers, which Apatow co-directed along with documentarian Michael Bonfiglio, won the SXSW Audience Award at the 2018 SXSW Film Festival.

[6] The film was a box office success. Apatow co-produced the 2013 sequel, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues. [41] He made his feature directorial debut in 2005 with the comedy The 40-Year-Old Virgin, which he also co-wrote with the film's star, Steve Carell, for Universal Pictures. The film opened at number one at the box office and grossed more than $175 million globally. [35] The comedy garnered numerous awards and nominations, including being named one of AFI's Top Movies of the Year, as well as taking home Best Comedy Movie at the 11th annual Critics' Choice Awards. [42] The 40-Year-Old Virgin also earned Apatow a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America and received four MTV Movie Award nominations, including a win for Carell for Best Comedic Performance. [43] In 2005, Apatow co-wrote with Nicholas Stoller the feature film comedy Fun with Dick and Jane starring Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni. The film went on to gross $202 million worldwide. [44] [45] His second film, the romantic comedy Knocked Up, was released in June 2007 to wide critical acclaim. Apatow wrote the initial draft of the film on the set of Talladega Nights. [27] The story concerns a slacker and a media personality (Rogen and Heigl, respectively) whose one-night stand results in an unintended pregnancy. In addition to being a critical success, the film was also a commercial hit, continuing Apatow's newfound mainstream success.\n\nIn 2010, Apatow served as producer on the Forgetting Sarah Marshall spin-off Get Him to the Greek with Russell Brand reprising his role and Jonah Hill returning from the original film, albeit as a different character. Released by Universal, the film did well at the box office, grossing more than 60 million dollars. [62] In 2011, Apatow produced the most successful R-rated female comedy of all time, Bridesmaids, [63] which received Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress ( Melissa McCarthy ) and Best Original Screenplay ( Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig ), as well as two Golden Globe Award nominations and two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. Bridesmaids also won a Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Comedy Movie, a People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy Movie and was named one of AFI's Movies of the Year. [64] That same year, he produced Girls after seeing Lena Dunham's 2010 film Tiny Furniture. In a January 2013 interview in Fast Company, Apatow and Dunham discussed the creative process of working on the show, saying that \"this type of show is an auteur's vision. It isn't collaborative in the same way as other shows. We are probably closer to Curb Your Enthusiasm than we are to something like Friends.\" [65] Apatow produced Wanderlust (2012), starring Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd as a married couple who leave New York City and live in a hippie commune. [66] He also produced The Five-Year Engagement (2012), featuring Jason Segel and Emily Blunt as a couple who have a rocky five-year engagement. [67]\n\n \"Judd Apatow Strikes Down Diane Keaton"

Gladys cared about Michael enough to tell the world that his daughter was wrong and out of line. On her twitter account, she still defended what she stated and let that be. Emmanuel Lewis (friend) Emmanuel Lewis. Emmanuel Lewis met Michael in the early 1980s when he was on the show Webster. He, along with Brooke Shields accompanied Michael to the 1984 American Music Awards and Grammys. Michael would often go places with Emmanuel and would hang out with his family. During the rough times in Michael's life, Emmanuel has always supported him. He could have been like Corey Feldman and told fables about Michael to the press for publicity but he never did. Instead, he went to college and even ran his own record label. Tom Mesereau (friend) Tom Mesereau. If there was anyone that really know what the word \"friend\" means, that would be Tom Mesereau. I know that I stated on this blog that Randy made a \"mistake\" putting Mesereau in Michael's life after the fact he defended the author Randall Sullivan regarding his book on Michael. At times, I forget that there are reasons why people do what they do and even though I did not agree with Mr. Mesereau's reasons for supporting the book, I do understand. With that said, I would like to take back what I stated about Mr. Mesereau and applaud him for continuing to stand by Michael when low life scum want to destroy his legacy because they did not save up all of the money they made \"choreographing\" lame moves for less than great dancers. Mr. Mesereau have been constantly defending Michael's innocence and his good name to anyone that would listen to him because he knows that he must do that for him. No one asked him to defend Michael and that is the greatness about Mr. Mesereau. His defense of Michael's is effortless, respectable and reasonable. He does not defend Michael halfway but defends him all the way and he does not care how anyone would feel about it.\n\nMore information A Miraculous Announcement Luke 2:1-20 A Miraculous Announcement Luke 2:1-20 Introduction: I.
